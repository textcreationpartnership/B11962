            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </seg>Hen the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had by the preaching of the Goſpell planted a Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <note place="margin">Acts. 20.</note> was for like purpoſes to depart from thence to other places, he left <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> the Euangeliſt there aſwell to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his doctrine and water that he had planted, as to ordaine ordinarie miniſters and officers, who might by continuall tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, gouerning and prouiding for the poore, keepe that church in good eſtate, &amp; carry the ſame forward vnto perfection.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe <hi>Timothie</hi> was a young man, the buſineſſe committed vnto him waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his enemies and temptations many and mightie, he writes this Epiſtle vnto
<pb facs="tcp:177788:5"/> him, as he hath ſaid in the former verſe, that he might know how to behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Church, which for excellencie he calles the houſe of God, the piller and ground of truth.</p>
            <p>Now hauing in the former part of this chapter, ſhewed what Miniſters ſhould be choſen, and how they ſhould be qualified, in theſe words he ſhewes a reaſon thereof drawne from the matter, whereabout they muſt be occupied, which is, not in genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies &amp; Iewiſh fables, which he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them before, as too trifling and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable <note place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> things for Miniſters to ſpende their time in, but they muſt be occupyed about the doctrine of pietie and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie: now as they muſt be ſpeciall men, ſo they muſt bee occupied about ſpeciall matters that are ſecret and vnknowne to the world, that are of great vſe and benefit to the Church, and that are amiable and admirable to the Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great is the miſterie of godlineſſe:</hi> Now the former deſcription of Miniſters laide with this doctrine for Miniſters, doth ſhew they muſt be wiſe, religious, and ſanctified men, that ſhall teach religion to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, otherwiſe they ſhall preach at the leaſt in a great part that which themſelues doe
<pb facs="tcp:177788:5"/> not vnderſtand, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nichodemus; Art thou a Teacher in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and knowes not theſe things,</hi> and as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> who in the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Teſtament prooues themſelues to be the teachers of all men, yet ſhew they vnderſtand not the myſterie of religion, for they haue paſſed ouer theſe words with ſilence, and ſpeake not a worde of this text that doth containe ſo great a matter, <hi>For without controuerſie</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>great is the myſterie of godlineſſe or religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he ſaith <hi>Without controuerſie,</hi> he meanes it is confeſſed of all nations and of all ſortes of men, that religion is a great thing, for although there be diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, which is the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Iewes thinke it is contained in their <hi>Talmud,</hi> the Turkes thinke it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their <hi>Alcaron,</hi> the Papiſts thinke it is contained in their Maſſe-booke, and we ſay it is contained in the Scripture; yet all doe confeſſe, and it is out of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that religion is a great thing: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many doe not approoue of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, yet it being granted that this is the true religion, to looke for ſaluation in and by Ieſus Chriſt, who was God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, all will agree it is a great
<pb facs="tcp:177788:6"/> miſtery, he hath ſaid in the former verſe, he write in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he might know how to behaue himſelfe in the Church the piller and ground of truth; now he ſaith immediately, <hi>Great is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Godlineſſe or Religion,</hi> teaching vs that is the true and godly religion, that is grounded in the trueth or word of God: and that hath alwayes beene profeſſed in the Church, and that all the religions that are out of the Church, and that doe diſſent from the word, are vntrue and vngodly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miſterie,</hi> He calles true religion a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, becauſe it is hidden from and refuſed of the moſt, becauſe it is perceiued and therefore imbraced but of a few: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is preached but in part of any, and well may the Apoſtle call true religion a Miſtery, for the Heathens dreame not of it; the Iewes deny it, Papiſtes peruert it: yea many that are in the viſible Church doe not perceiue it, at leaſt the trueth and godlineſſe of it, but doe take ſuperficiall knowledge for ſound knowledge, a dead faith for a liuely faith, and counterfeite godlineſſe for true godlineſſe: and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, for religion is contrary to nature and reaſon: the eye of religion <hi>Adam</hi> hath put out, and all men are blinde vntill they be
<pb facs="tcp:177788:6"/> againe enlightned by grace: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>The naturall man perceiues not the things of God; neyther can he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

               <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</hi> If re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, could haue beene perceiued by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon, the wiſe Philoſophers would haue found it out, but in all their writings there is a perpetuall ſilence of it.</p>
            <p>No man can by reaſon iudge certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of many naturall things ſubiect to ſence, as the exceeding ſwiftneſſe, magnitude and altitude of the Sunne, Moone and Starres, of the cauſes and effects of the thunder, lightnings, earthquakes: and how much leſſe can men pearce into Gods ſecrets with their owne eyes. There be many artes and trades, in the world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them is called a miſtery, becauſe the perceiuerance and practiſe of them, is beyond the reach of common men that haue not beene bound prentiſe to them, how much more muſt the art of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and religion needes be miſticall.</p>
            <p>All other religions are not miſteries, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially not great miſteries, but may be perceiued and conceiued by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but true religion cannot.</p>
            <p>Yea the Apoſtle calles it a miſtery, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of thoſe that be irreligious
<pb facs="tcp:177788:7"/> and haue no perceiuerance of it, but as I ſaid in reſpect of thoſe that be religious, who although they know it truly, yet they know it not perfectly, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all other Chriſtians, <hi>We know in part, if we know any thing, but in part it is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nay that which is more, religion may be called a miſterie, in reſpect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for they knowe it not fully, as <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> ſaith, for hauing ſpoken of the Prophets, foretelling of Chriſts ſuffrings and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſtians, he ſaith, <hi>the which things the Angels deſire to beholde.</hi> And that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a great myſterie, we ſhall more plainely ſee by the opening of the Text, and handling of the wordes as they follow in order.</p>
            <p>But before we come to the particulers of it, let vs marke generally: that ſeeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a great thing, we muſt not account it little, nor vnderpriſe it as many doe, but iudge and eſteeme highly of it, and thinke all things in the world little, in reſpect of it, and other perſons no body, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe that haue it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore let vs marke, that ſeeing religion is a miſterie, we muſt neither be ſo arrogant, as to thinke we can eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="tcp:177788:7"/> and vnderſtand it, nor ſo negligent, as not to enquire and ſearch after it, but humbly and diligently, by hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by reading the Scriptures, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with good men, who are beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, and eſpecially by prayer vnto God, ſeeke and labour to be inſtructed in it. Men are inquiſitiue after court newes, and ſtrange newes, that concernes great perſons and great matters, that euery one knowes not: then let vs enquire for this heauenlye myſterie that concernes the higheſt.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, ſeeing he calles religion the miſterie of godlineſſe, let vs note it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie both in the knowledge of it, and in the practice of it. Therefore as none can tell what true godlineſſe meanes but thoſe that be religious, ſo none can tell what true religion meanes but thoſe that be godly: there is no religious man but hee that is godly, and there is no godly man but he that is religious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God manifeſted, &amp;c.</hi> Now we come to the words of the Text, wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſets downe the ſubſtance of religion, which at the firſt view ſeemes a matter not hard to conceiue, but by the examination of the circumſtances of it, we ſhall by the
<pb facs="tcp:177788:8"/> grace of God ſee how truely and fitly the Apoſtle hath called it a miſterie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſome partes of religion that are not plainly expreſſed in this Text, as that of election and the reſurrection, &amp;c. Yet both thoſe and all the parts of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are comprehended in theſe words; for it is ſaid, <hi>God hath elected vs in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 1. Ioh. 11.</note> and alſo <hi>that we ſhall be raiſed vp againe by him:</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith; <hi>Euery ſpirite which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> 
               <hi>confeſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God, and euery ſpirit which deemeth that Ieſus Chriſt is not come in the fleſh, is not of God:</hi> as there is no hereſie or falſe religion, but doth impugne Chriſt, either in whole or in part, but doth deny him in his names, in his natures, or his offices: ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, there is no part of true religion but hath reference vnto Chriſt: therfore when he comes to ſet downe the miſterie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he ſaith it is this, <hi>God is manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that religion followes from God to man, and againe leades man to God: the miſtery of it is, that God and man, the creator and the creature, is ioyned togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which as one ſaith; Is ſuch a thing that to ſpeake of, no man is worthy, and to vtter no man is able. What then ſhall I
<pb facs="tcp:177788:8"/> doe (ſaith he) ſhall I be ſilent, or ſhall I ſpeake: be ſilent I dare not, leaſt I ſhould conceale ſo great a benefit: ſpeake I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, leaſt I ſhould obſcure ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>Now that we might the better ſee the greatneſſe of this miſtery, that <hi>God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> as it were with a paire of ſpectacles, let vs briefely conſider on the one ſide what God is, and on the other ſide what man is.</p>
            <p>And yet I meane not to enter into any large diſcription of God, leaſt we ſhould thinke he may be fully conceiued: for one ſaith truely and wittily; If all the world were full of bookes, if all the creatures in the world were writers, and all the water in the ſea were inke, the writers would be wearied, the bookes would be filled, and the ſea would be emptied and exhauſted before his perfection could be manifeſted.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Simonides</hi> being asked what God was, deſired a dayes reſpit to make anſwere; and being asked the next day, he deferred two dayes reſpit; and againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked the third time, ſaide; the more I ſearch it, the further I am from it.</p>
            <p>When I ſeeke for God ſaith one of the ancient fathers, I doe not ſeeke for the gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb facs="tcp:177788:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> beauties of Dyamondes, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones for the eye: I doe not ſeeke for the pleaſant melodie of birdes and tuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtruments for the eare, I do not ſeeke for the ſauour of flowers, ſpices, and oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſmell; I doe not ſeeke for hony, and delectable things for the taſte, which brute beaſtes may be capable of, but I ſeeke for a glory aboue all beauty, for a voyce aboue all melodie, and for a ſauour and ſweetneſſe aboue all delicacie, which neither beaſtes, nor men with their outward cenſes can attaine vnto.</p>
            <p>God is the moſt abſolute, ſupreame &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celent thing, a ſubſtance deuine, inuiſible, eternall, infinite, vnchangeable, glorious, almightie, onely wiſe, true, iuſt, mercifull, gracious and bountifull, before whom the <note place="margin">Eſa. 6.</note> Cherubins do couer their faces, of whom, thorow whom &amp; for whom are all things, <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, to him be glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Now as God is thus, and much more excellent then can be ſpoken, ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; man eſpecially conſidered as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath left him, is moſt baſe, inſomuch that <hi>Dauid</hi> comparing man but with ſome of the creatures ſaid. <hi>What is man that thou art mindfull of him, and the ſonne of man that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> 
               <hi>thou doeſt conſider him;</hi> how much more
<pb facs="tcp:177788:9"/> compared with the Creator. Yea man is not onely baſe, but miſerable; and ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that if Chriſt had not come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs, it had beene better for vs we had beene ſtones, yea beares, and toades: therefore ſeeing all that can be ſaide is too little, to ſet forth Gods maieſty; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid enough to ſet forth mans miſery, this that the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>That God is manyfeſt in the fleſh,</hi> muſt needes be a great miſtery. By God the Apoſtle meanes, not the firſt perſon in the diety, which is the father, nor the third perſon, which is the holye Ghoſt; but the ſecond perſon which is the Sonne: for though there bee but one God, yet in the Godhead there <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> are three perſons, the father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt: Now it was the ſonne, the ſecond perſon, that was more manifeſted in the fleſh as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>The word was made</hi>

               <hi>the Godhead bodily:</hi> And yet we are not to thinke he was thruſt out of heauen, as the euill Angels were, but he tooke fleſh of his owne accorde, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the ſecond to the <hi>Phillipians, he being equal with
<pb facs="tcp:177788:10"/> God tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant:</hi> for as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned and ouerthrew mankinde voluntarily, ſo it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould take our nature, and redeeme vs voluntarily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> By fleſh he meanes not the body of man onely, but our whole humane nature, conſiſting of ſoule and body: As when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſuffred in the</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Yet we muſt not imagine two Chriſtes, one that was God, and another that was man, but one Chriſt who is both God and man: the diuell hath ſtirred vp ſome heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes to deny his Godhead, and ſome to deny his manhood; and ſome alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them together, thinking to corrupt this miſtery, and ſo to ouerthrow religion: thoſe that haue denied his Godhead, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for colour thereof, our Sauiour Chriſtes owne wordes: <hi>My father is greater</hi>

               <hi>ſinne, neither was there guile found in his mouth;</hi> So that though he had true fleſh, yet he had but the ſimilitude of ſinnefull fleſh, thoſe that confound his two natures, as if the one of them did deſtroy the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were led thereto by this; that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſometime attribute that to his manhood, which belongeth to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as that it is ſaide, the ſonne of man is in heauen; when he talked with the Iewes and ſometimes doth attribute that to his God-head, which belongings, to his man, hood, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith to the elders of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:177788:12"/> was becauſe he did not onely take on him our nature, but our caſe and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, the frailties and infirmities of our nature, I meane not our ſinfull infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, for that is alwayes excepted in his humanity, elſe how ſhould he haue beene ioyned to God, who can abide no impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; but I meane, he tooke on him our naturall infirmities, both of minde and body.

But we are not to thinke that he tooke on him euery particuler mans infirmities, that grow of ſome ſpeciall cauſe, franzineſſe of minde, or lameneſſe of body, but generally the infirmityes, which bee common to the nature of all men; that hauing experyence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, he might be able to ſuccour vs in ours, as the Apoſtle ſaith. <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note>

            <p>But is this all the miſtery of religion, to know that the Godhead was ioyned to our baſe and fraile nature: No, but there is much more in it, that doth carrie our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration a great deale further, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the wordes of the text that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>He was preached to the Gentiles, and beleeued on in the worlde:</hi> yea it reaches not onely to this world, but to the worlde to come; <hi>He was receiued vp into glorye.</hi>

            <p>For Chriſt beeing preached to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> he was not preached in vayne, but as the Apoſtle ſaith, he was beleeued on in the world; not of all the world, for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">2.

            </p>
            <p>This is not the leaſt part of this great miſtery that Chriſt is beleeued on in the

            <p>I will not enter into a common place of faith, becauſe I purpoſe not to go from the Apoſtles purpoſe, onely thgat we may not be deceiued in iudging of it, as many are, let vs knowe that faith is a precious and vnſpeakeable gift; which God by his holy ſpirit workes in the hartes of his elect in meaſure, whereby a man doeth applye Chriſt and all his good things to himſelfe, with comfortable aſſurance, and whereby he is prouoked and inabled to thankefull obedience; thus Chriſt being preached, he was beleeued on in the worlde, not talked on onely, but beleeued on alſo, he was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on of many, and beleeued on of ſome though but few in compariſon as it is now, but we muſt not reſt in lip faith, but labour for hart faith, not reſt in faith of the fleſh,

            <p>This is a part of this miſtery, to beleeue that Chriſt being in heauen, and we in earth, Chriſt beeing glorious and we baſe, Chriſt being pure and we defiled, ſhould be one with vs and we with him.</p>

Some may therevpon aske this queſtion; Doth Chriſt belong to wicked men? no, not ſo long as they bee wicked: but the Apoſtles did preache this miſterie of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and ſaluation in Chriſt, to thoſe that do repent, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>Amend your liues,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts. 2.</note>

            <p>Repentance is a godly ſorrow, riſing from the ſight of our ſinnes, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due vnto them, which cauſes a man to hate the deuill, euill men, and euill things; to loue God, good men, and good things in his minde, and to forſake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill euill men, and euill things: and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God, good men, and good things, in his maners: but it is not ſo needfull to ſhew now what repentance is, as to perſwade men to go about it: neither is it ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſhew whether faith or repentance be wrought firſt in a man, ſeeing they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ioyned together, and are at no time
<pb facs="tcp:177788:23"/> ſeparated in a good man: repentance though it may be ſaid to be the laſt in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it is the firſt in feeling.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Gentiles</hi> when they heard the Goſpell, beleeued in Chriſt, as we may ſee in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and in thoſe that burned their <note place="margin">Luk. 19 Acts. 19.</note> bookes of curious Artes at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and many other: therefore thoſe that became Chriſtians, are in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Saints; and if any that had beene recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the Church vpon a counterfeite ſhew of repentance, did returne to his olde ſinnes, the ſcripture appoints him to be caſt out and deliuered to Sathan, as vnworthy of a Chriſtian eſtate; but thoſe that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beleeue in Chriſt, became true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſuch as were redeemed, iuſtified and ſanctified by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Receiued vp into glory.</hi> That is his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for his Godhead was alwayes in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; but the Apoſtle meanes he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into glorie in his manhood, that he might enioy that life which was promiſed to thoſe that keepe the law; this is that he prayed for, <hi>Father glorifie thy ſonne with that glorie that I had with thee before the worlde</hi>

            <p>This is that which is ſaid of him, that hee ſitteth at the right hand of God, <note place="margin">Ephe. 1.</note> that is as <hi>Paule</hi> expounded it, exalted farre aboue all principalitye and power, <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> as it is ſaid to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> hee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe to the death of the Croſſe, wherefore God hath exalted him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

            <p>This is a great miſtery, that he which was brought ſo lowe, ſhould be exalted ſo high: but is this all that he was glorified in his perſon? No, but that he might glorifie his members as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Theſſelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>He ſhall be gloryfied in his Saints, and made maruelous in all thoſe that do beleeue;</hi> he laid not downe our nature againe, when he had wrought our redemption, but carried it with him into heauen, as one ſaith when Chriſt went away from vs, hee lefte vs his pawne, that is his ſpirit, to aſſure vs hee would come againe to vs, and tooke with him our pawne that is our fleſh, to aſſure vs we ſhould come to him, according as hee ſaith in <hi>Iohn,</hi> I goe to prepare a place for you, that where I am there you may bee alſo.</p>
            <p>This is the miſterye that the ſonne of God came downe to the earth tofetch vs vp to heauen that after hee had ſanctified our humayne nature in himſelfe, he might

            <p>But our Sauiour Chriſt not regarding what would pleaſe him, but profit him, condemnes his firſt birth, and telles him, he muſt of neceſſity be borne againe: neither doth he ſpeake of <hi>Nichodemus</hi> in perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but of all men in generall: for ſaith he; <hi>Except a man be borne againe:</hi> and not of men onely but women alſo; for that which was <hi>Nichodemus</hi> his condition, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all by their firſt birth: the Potter would not breake his pot to make it againe except it were ill made; ſo God would not regenerate men, except they were euill ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.</p>
            <p>Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt dooth in theſe words both condemne our firſt birth, and vrge the neceſſity of a new birth: as if he ſhould ſay; except a man in the time of his life become better then hee is by his birth, except a man be againe begotten of God, who is a better father in the wombe <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18</note> of the Church, that is a better mother by the worde; that is immortall and better <note place="margin">1.

               <hi>Nichodemus</hi> ſaid, how can a man bee <note place="margin">Verſe. 4.</note> borne that is olde: let vs marke, he applies that which our Sauiour ſpake generally to himſelfe perticularly, as if he ſhould ſay, if a man muſt be borne againe, then I muſt be borne againe that am an olde man; this we are to imitate in him, to apply generall doctrine to our ſelues perticulerly, and this doctrine of regeneration eſpecially, for many haue liued 40. yea 60. yeare that are not an houre olde in Chriſtianity: <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> ſpeakes not this in ſcorne, as ſome may thinke, but indeede of ignorance, as yee may ſee in the tenth verſe.</p>
            <p>It is as if he ſhould ſay to Chriſt, thou ſaieſt a man muſt be borne againe, but olde men their mothers are dead, and if they were not? how ſhould they that are ſtiffe and vnwildeſome enter into their mothers wombe and be borne againe? Who would haue looked for ſuch an anſwer as this from ſo great a clarke; but the generation of the Papiſtes are as groſſe as the generation of

            <p>The Papiſtes take theſe wordes to bee ſpoken of baptiſme, and ſay, except a man be baptiſed he cannot be ſaued, putting a neceſſity in baptiſme vnto ſaluation; it is true indeed that baptiſme is neceſſary, and that to ſaluation, as all the meanes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which God hath appointed are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and cannot be contemned without peril of condemnation; but baptiſme is not neceſſary to ſaluation in their ſence, as if none could be ſaued except they be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, for the thiefe that was crucified with <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 1</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſt, who was conuerted after baptiſme, was inſtituted, was ſaued, and yet he was not baptiſed, ſo if any ſhould die without baptiſme when they would &amp; cannot haue it, it hinders not their ſaluation: if infants die before they be brought to baptiſme, though negligence herein may be a ſinne in the parents, yet is it no preiudice to the childe, no more then it was to thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that died without circumſition when they might not apply it before the eight day, for if the want of baptiſme ſhould be ſhutte from ſaluation, then it were poſſible to ouerthrow the election of God, which <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> Chriſt denies.</p>

            <p>There be ſome things in nature indeed that muſt not bee caſt off, as the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoule and members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but whatſoeuer is corrupt in nature muſt bee layde aſide: not iudgement, but the corruption of iudgement: not affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 26</note> as ſome thinke all anger is ſinne, but the corruption of affection: So not the members of the bodye, as ſome haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thoſe wordes of our Sauiour Chriſt; <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 29</note> 
               <hi>If thine eye offend thee plucke it out, &amp;c.</hi> but the corruption of thoſe members, and ſo of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>And as the Scripture doth command vs to caſt off the corruption of nature generally, ſo perticulerly, &amp; ſaith: Lie not, ſweare not, ſteale not, commit not adultery, kill not, &amp;c. Some will lay aſide ſome ſinnes in their manners, but not the loue of them in
<pb facs="tcp:177788:37"/> their mindes, as the <hi>Phariſes</hi> were outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like painted Tombes, but inwardly full of rottenneſſe: ſome will leaue ſome little ſinnes, but not great ſinnes; as <hi>Herod</hi> that reformed many things, but would not put awaye his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife: and ſome will leaue ſome great ſinnes, but not little <note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> ſinnes, they will not forſweare, but they will ſweate in their common talke, they will not rob openly, but they will deceiue ſecretly.</p>
            <p>But all theſe are borne of the fleſh, &amp; not of the ſpirite: In the new hiſtory of Scot-land there is mention made of a controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene Scotland and Ireland, for an Iland lying betweene them both, at length it was put to the determination of a wiſe Frenchman, whoſe order was that a ſnake ſhould be put into the Iland aliue, and if it did ſtill liue, the Iland ſhould belong to Scotland, and if not, it ſhould belong to Ireland, becauſe it is ſaid there are no ſnakes in Ireland; which is aleaged to this ende, to ſhew that if the venomous corruptions of our nature doe liue and thriue in men, they belong to the kingdome of Sathan: for that which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and cannot enter into the kingdome of God. <hi>And that which is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:37"/> That is, he that is a ſpirituall man, is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 15.</note> minded, &amp; walkes after the ſpirit: as he that is borne of the fleſh is carnally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1</note> and walkes after the fleſh, ſo he that is borne againe of the ſpirit is ſpiritually min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and manuered.</p>
            <p>He meanes not that the ſubſtance of the ſpirite is infuſed into a regenerate man, as the familie doe dreame, but the qualities and guiftes of the ſpirite: neyther is it meant that a regenerate man that is borne of the ſpirite, is all ſpirite, as a naturall man is all fleſh; for wee muſt not thinke any man can be perfect in this life. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe which is true, much more <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 12</note> of others, That he was not come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but onely did ſtriue vnto it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the <hi>Romans</hi> hee complaines of his imperfections, which hee calles the lawe <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> of his members or remnants of the fleſh, that ſtill did rebell againſt the ſpirite: for although Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 9</note> 
               <hi>borne of God ſinnes not,</hi> yet the meaning is not, that hee ſinnes not at all: for in the firſt Chapter hee ſaith; If wee ſay we haue no ſinne, wee lye, and ſinne in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.</p>
            <p>But the meaning is as ſome take it, hee ſinnes not as hee is borne of God, or ſo
<pb facs="tcp:177788:38"/> farre as he is regenerate, but as the moſt take it he ſinnes not as he did before he was regenerate, willingly and notoriouſlye, therfore when our Sauiour ſaith, that which is borne of the ſpirit is ſpirit, the meaning is, he that is regenerate is a ſpirituall man, not the fleſh, but the ſpirit, not the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, but the ſanctifying grace of God dooth rule and is predominate in him.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſinnes of the children of God are called infirmities, becauſe they proceede from corruption that is weakened and made infirme in them by grace; and therfore the duties of the children of God are called good workes becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from grace, but paſſing by our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, our will, our affection, our tongues, handes, and other members, that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt by nature, and but in part ſanctified, they receiue ſome defilement: yet becauſe the motion from whence they come, being the motion of Gods grace, the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they tend being Gods glorye, and the ground whereon they ſtand beeing Gods worde is good, therefore they are called good workes, are accounted good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the faith of Chriſt; who &amp; whoſe workes were abſolutely good, and therfore the workes of thoſe that are regenerate and
<pb facs="tcp:177788:38"/> beleeue in him, are accounted as his are, for this cauſe a regenerate man is called a ſpirituall man, taking his name of the more excellent part: as a man is called a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike man, not as if he had no fleame or choller in him; but becauſe that humour beares the greateſt ſway in him: ſo a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is called a ſpirituall man, not as if there were no remnantes of fleſh in him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpirit beares the greateſt ſwaye and ouer rules corruption in him: therefore we muſt put a difference betweene iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation &amp; ſanctification. The Papiſtes ſpeake of ſuch a ſanctification as may iuſtifie a man before God, but iuſtification muſt be teached by faith from Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe perfect iuſtice is imputed to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es: and as a naturall man hath no ſorrow for ſin, further then feare of man or ſhame doth force him, ſo he hath no ioy in good things, further then pride or vainglory doth pricke him; ſo that to vſe the common ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the ſcripture, as we may know a good tree from a bad tree, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their fruites, ſo we may know a ſpirituall man from a carnall man, by the difference of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mindes and manners. A regenerate man that is borne of the ſpirite, though he be not perfectly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this life, yet hee is wholely ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: for as there is a naturall birth of the whole man, ſo there is a ſpirituall birth of the whole man, that is, as all the partes both of his ſoule and bodie are vitiated and corrupted by the firſt birth, ſo all the partes of his ſoule and bodye, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, affection, his will, his conſcience, his memory, his eyes, his tongue, handes, feete, &amp;c. are ſanctified by his ſecond and new birth; and there is no part of a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man ſo corrupt as it was before: I ſpeake not of ſome extraordynarye fault, that ſome good man may fall into by
<pb facs="tcp:177788:40"/> ſtrong temptation, which peraduenture hee committed not, nor the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion, but I ſpeake of that ordinarye eſtate that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are brought vnto by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore we are in the Scripture not onely exhorted generally to put on the new man, to be renewed, to amend out liues, to be holy, as God is holy, but wee are exhorted to the perticuler vertues and partes of the new man, as to knowledge, loue, pacience, temperance, humility, and diuers other partes of ſanctification: there is no naturall man but doth ſomething that is good in it ſelfe, though it bee not ſo to him; but a regenerate man is good many wayes within and without, in wordes and indeedes.</p>
            <p>Againe hee that is borne againe of the ſpirit, doth grow in grace and the guiftes of the ſpirite, that is, not onely to adde one grace to another, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:177788:42"/> more wonderfull is it to be created and made a new: it is a greater matter to regenerate a man, then it was to create the worlde; for at the firſt God created all things with a worde, but to recreate a man there muſt be wordes and deedes to, Chriſt muſt be borne for vs that wee might bee borne againe in him, Chriſt muſt dye for vs, that our olde man might bee ſlaine, and muſt be quickned and riſe againe for vs, that a new creature might bee reuiued and reſtored in vs: therefore regeneration is a thing to bee maruelled at, as manye other of the great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent workes of God bee; but when Chriſt biddes <hi>Nichodemus</hi> not maruell, hee meanes ſuch a marueling as fighteth againſt faith, and cauſes a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect a thing as fabulous, becauſe hee cannot conceiue it; but to wonder at Gods grace and power in the regenerate, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues and our ſences to the word and worke of God, there in is a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing.</p>
            <p>But marke wee that <hi>Nichodemus</hi> not being regenerate himſelfe, regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a riddle to him, as the Papiſtes and thoſe that haue not true faith themſelues thinke that none can bee

            <p>Reaſon with many men about the points of religion, as faith, repentance, and the like, you ſhall finde ſuch vnſauorie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and caueling ſpeeches, as it would make a ſpirituall man to wonder they ſhoulde bee ſo ignorant and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>

            <p>Let Miniſters learne by our Sauiour Chriſtes example, to vſe all meanes, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, confutation and reprehenſion, euen to great men when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neede require, they periſh elſe: and learne by <hi>Nichodemus</hi> his example, to make vſe of theſe things though it bee long firſt, by doctrine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ignorance, by confutation to reforme our errors, and by reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reforme our ſinnes and amend our liues.</p>
            <p>Afterwarde the ſpirite of God in his good time did blowe vpon <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> and by the grace thereof he was made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thoſe things which he could not perceiue when hee was a naturall man: Therefore let vs learne once more, and once for euer, that though the Miniſter vſes neuer ſo great wiſedome, neuer ſo great zeale, neuer ſo great faithfulneſſe, conſtancie and patience in teaching and admoniſhing of men, yet without Gods bleſſing and grace all ſhall be in vaine vnto

This place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I haue choſen, as I promiſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to ſhew howe ſmall a number in compariſon, are pertakers of the miſterie of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe wordes doe containe a Parable, wherein our Sauiour Chriſt, as is vſuall in Parables, dooth by ſimilitudes and familier examples borrowed from earthly things, <note place="margin">Prou. 1.</note> ſet foorth heauenly things. <hi>Salomon</hi> calles Parables, darke ſayings; and ſo they are if they bee not expounded: as this Parable were darke, if the explanation that Chriſt makes of it afterwarde were not added.
<pb facs="tcp:177788:48"/> This is called the Parable of the ſower, and containes certaine borrowed ſpeaches ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from husbandrie, and ſuch things as concernes the body; whereby is ſet foorth ſuch things as concerne the ſoule.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt had propounded this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the Diſciples did aske him the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Verſe. 10</note> of it, as wee may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee in verſe 10. and in the 14. verſe hee comes to expound it to them.</p>
            <p>To the ſower he compares the Miniſter, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9.</note> who is by <hi>Paul</hi> called Gods labourer: to the ſeed he compares the worde, in the 14. <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 23.</note> verſe, which <hi>Peter</hi> calles immortall ſeede of our new birth: to the ground he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9.</note> the heartes of men, which <hi>Paul</hi> calls Gods husbandrie: and <hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erem. 4. 4.</hi> calles them fallowe ground that had neede bee plowed vp: to the fruite he compares the duties of holineſſe and righteouſnes, which <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> the word requires and workes in men.</p>
            <p>The drift of the Parable is, to ſhewe though many doe heare, yet the worde takes no effect, nor brings foorth no fruite in the moſt, becauſe of their vnfitneſſe for it; ſome giue the worde no entertainment at all, but it goeth in at one eare and out at the other.</p>
            <p>Some receiues it, but ſo ſhallowly that it
<pb facs="tcp:177788:48"/> vaniſhes againe quickly: ſome doe more deepely conſider of it. But there be other things that ſpred further and thriue better, which choake the worde ſo that it comes to nothing, onely there bee a fewe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that doe heare the worde, conceiue it, retaine it, and bring foorth the fruite of it.</p>
            <p>But before we come to the perticulers of the parable, let vs marke generally, that the Miniſter who is called Gods labourer, muſt ſowe the ſeede of the worde, that is, he muſt preach the Goſpell, or elſe he hath the name of a ſower in vaine. This our Sauiour Chriſt commaunds his Diſciples, ſaying; <hi>Goe to all nations and preach:</hi> and <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> commaundes <hi>Timothie</hi> and others to preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> and ſayth of himſelfe; <hi>Woe vnto mee if I</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>preach not the Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon is that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Where Propheſiyng or Preaching fayles, the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. 29.</note> 
               <hi>people periſh.</hi> And that the Lorde ſpeakes <note place="margin">Eze. 33.</note> to <hi>Ezechiel; If thou tell not the people of their ſinnes, they ſhall dye in their ſinnes, but their bloud I will require at thy band.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly let vs marke, that as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt preach, ſo the people muſt heare; for it is a neceſſarye conſequent
<pb facs="tcp:177788:49"/> from the preaching of the Miniſter, to the hearing of the people: therefore it is a great and common accuſation in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt the people, that God ſent hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Prophets early and they would not heare.</p>
            <p>It is in the end of this Parable, and often in other places ſaid; <hi>Hee that hath an eare, let him heare:</hi> and he that will not, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Adder that ſtoppes his eares, and will not heare the voyce of the charmer, charme hee neuer ſo wiſely. As there can bee no fruite looked for where ſeede is not ſowne, ſo there can bee no goodneſſe in them that doe not heare: for although all bee not good that doe heare, yet there bee none good but thoſe that are to bee picked out among hearers, both which are ſhewed by the courſe of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly let vs marke, it is not enough to heare, for in this Parable Chriſt ſhews ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye doe ſo, and are neuer the better: but men and women muſt obey and practiſe that they heare: as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith; <hi>Be do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>the word, and not hearers, onely deceiuing your owne ſelues.</hi> For our Sauiour ſaith; <hi>They are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> 
               <hi>bleſſed that heare the worde of God and keepe it:</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith; <hi>Thoſe that doe not are curſed.</hi> Now becauſe <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:49"/> the moſt hearers do not practiſe the word, our Sauiour Chriſt in this Parable ſhewes where the fault is: not in the ſower or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, hee is one to all; nor in the ſeede or worde of God, that is one in all; but in the ground, that is the peoples hearts, they are not one but diuers; ſome are hard harted, ſome are fickle minded, ſome are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſlie and carnally affected, fewe are carefully and conſcionablie diſpoſed, to the loue, reuerence and obedience of that they heare.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the parts of the parable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some fell by the highway.</hi> Our Sauiour <note place="margin">Verſe. 4.</note> Chriſt ſaith; When the ſower ſowes his feed, ſome falls by the highway ſide in the filding countries, the highway for trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to walke and ride in lyes hard by their corne grounds and headlands, vppon the which when the husbandman ſowes his ſeed, ſome of the corne doth ſprinckle and fall, but the ground whereon it fals is hard trampled and vnfit, therefore the ſeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter, but lyeth aloft, and the fowles that followe the ſower pick it vp: ſo ſaith <note place="margin">Verſe. 15.</note> our Sauiour Chriſt; ſome mens hearts are like to this kinde of ground, they are harde earth, the cuſtome of ſinning &amp; trampling of ſathan, and vnfit to receiue inſtruction.
<pb facs="tcp:177788:50"/> In <hi>Luke</hi> it is ſaid; <hi>Theſe men vnderſtand no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the word:</hi> the reaſon is, the deuill comes &amp; takes it away, as the fowles doe picke vp the ſeede: this is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſuch men; <hi>The God of this worlde hath blinded</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of this ſort of men we haue many, which <note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> calles <hi>forgetfull hearers,</hi> who though they can marke a tale of <hi>Robin-hood,</hi> as we ſay, though they can repeat a ſtory or olde wiues fable, yet they cannot rehearſe any profitable point of the Sermon, but are like thoſe that goe to a faire or market, neither to buy nor ſell, but to ſee &amp; be ſeene: ſuch be theſe church Papiſts, that come to ſpare their 20. pound a month, &amp; ciuill men that
<pb facs="tcp:177788:50"/> come to ſpare their 12. pence a ſunday, but not to ſeeke nor ſerue God, nor edifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: the reaſon of their vnprofitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is, becauſe the deuill is preſent with them, either to rock them a ſleep, that they might not heare at all, or to caſt in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of other matters to occupie their mindes, that though they heare a ſound, they might vnderſtand or beare away no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or if they doe marke any thing, it is ſome ſentence of Fathers or Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if there be any aleaged to garniſh their talke withall, that they might be like But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flies, who faſten vpon the flowers only to paint their wings. Or if they marke any thing out of the word, the deuill cauſes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put it of to others, &amp; to thinke that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes not them: as ſome wil ſay ſuch a one had a good leſſon to day: but if they take any thing to be ſpoken to themſelues, the deuil perſwades them the preacher ſpeakes of malice, and ſo reape no good by it, but <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note> rather hurt. <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſhewes the reaſon why the deuill ſeekes thus to take away the ſeed that is ſowne in their hearts, leaſt they ſhould beleeue and be ſaued. Therefore as M. <hi>Gyfford</hi> ſaith vpon this Parable; When we goe to heare the worde, let vs thinke wee goe about a hard buſineſſe, wee ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:177788:51"/> haue much a doe to keepe our eyes from ſleeping, to keepe our thoughts from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and our hearts from rebelling: and if we pray not to God, &amp; ſtriue not againſt the deuil, we ſhall either not heare though we come to heare, or elſe as the prouerbe is As good neuer a whit as neuer the better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some fell on ſtonie ground.</hi> This ground is ſomwhat better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former, for though <note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> it be ſtone in the bottome, yet it hath ſome earth in the top, and the ſeede takes a little roote and ſprings vp ſodainly, but the earth is ſo ſhallow, and the ſtones ſo many, that it cannot take any deepe roote, but when the heate comes it withers away. To this ground our Sauiour Chriſt compares ſome men that are not ſo ſenceleſſe as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but goe a degree further, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome beautie and excellencie in the Goſpell, feele ſome ſweetneſſe in it, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the <hi>Hebrews; They haue a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> 
               <hi>taſte of the good worde of God. Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Theſe men receiue the ſeede with ioye,</hi> they <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 13</note> will commend the Sermon and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and ſhewe a greene blade of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and flouriſhing ſhewe of religion: and though they haue ſome ioye in the worde, yet it is not in the commandement, to knowe and doe their dutie, but onely in
<pb facs="tcp:177788:51"/> the promiſes of the Goſpell, that ſets forth the grace of God and ſaluation in Chriſt, as if it belonged to them; and therefore it is ſaid, they beleeue for a time, but their <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 13</note> hearts be ſo hard that they cannot mourne for their ſinnes and wants: and though the worde be the meanes to ſoften mens harts, yet it cannot mollifie them, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtonie. There is nothing ſo harde but by arte and workemanſhip may be ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, mettals are melted with the fire, Yron is made plyable with the hammer, a Dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is broken with the bloud of a Goate, but ſome mens hearts are ſo hard, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hammer of the worde, the fire of hell, nor the bloud of Chriſt can ſoften them: there is great complainte of the ſtone in the raines, but fewe complaine of the ſtone in the hearte, or of a ſtonie heart.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaith, theſe men haue no roote <note place="margin">Verſe. 17</note> in themſelues, their religion ſtands in the Prince, in the Miniſter, in their bookes, in their wiues, in their friends, they haue no true vnderſtanding, nor power of grace in themſelues, that which is in them, it is in their tongues to ſpeake a little, their hearts are ſo harde within, that the worde cannot take roote enough to endure the ſtormes
<pb facs="tcp:177788:52"/> and trials of heate and colde, that it might bring forth fruite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They continue but a time.</hi> That is, their ioy they tooke in the word continues not, their freſh ſhew of religion continues not, as it is neceſſarie to imbrace the truth, ſo it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to continue in it, if we change, it cannot be for the better but for the worſe; Chriſt ſaith; <hi>If yee continue in my worde yee are verily my diſciples, if yee continue not ye are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> 
               <hi>not my aiſciples in deed, but in ſhew.</hi> Some continue too long in error and falſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Turkes, Papiſts, Anabaptiſts and others, but that is not conſtancie but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie: conſtancie is in the trueth, it is obſtinacie that is in error. <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſaid; <hi>Buy the truth, but ſell it not:</hi> therefore it is pittifull and fearefull, that ſome ſhould let it goe when they haue it.</p>
            <p>Apoſtacie is the moſt dangerous and vnrecouerable ſinne that may be, ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſcribed in the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſuch a man ſhould bee renued by <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> repentance: and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith; <hi>The prayers of the Church cannot helpe him: Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>It</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> 
               <hi>had beene better for him neuer to haue knowne</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Per. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the truth, then after he hath knowne it to turne from it:</hi> Therefore that hee might make this ſinne of Apoſtacie odious to all men,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:52"/> and Apoſtates odious to other men: hee compares them to the Sowe that was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and returnes to her wallowing in the mire, and to the Dogge that returnes and reſumes his vomit. Thoſe that haue beene Apoſtates, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Iulian,</hi> are neuer named in the Church but with deteſtation, ſuch a one is vnfit for the company of men, he muſt be giuen ouer to ſathan. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> calles the <hi>Galathians</hi> fooliſh <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> becauſe they did not runne out their race. Theſe ſtonie men though they be freſh at the firſt comming of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they are no body at the laſt, but are like to <hi>Plinies</hi> Lion, that at the firſt litter had fiue at a clap, after euery litter bated one, till at laſt ſhee had none at all. In worldlye matters mens after-wit is beſt, and ſhall it in matters of religion be worſt at laſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore let vs heare that waightie exhortation of the Apoſtle; <hi>Take heede</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> 
               <hi>leaſt at any time there bee in any of you an euill heart and vnfaithfull to depart from the liuing God.</hi> And ſo much the rather let vs take heede of it, becauſe our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith here, there bee ſome men that receiue the worde with ioye, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but a time. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith; Beleeue for <note place="margin">Luk. 8.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:53"/> a time, that is, profeſſe the faith for a time, not that they had iuſtifying faith at all, for that cannot be loſt, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeue in Chriſt ſhall not periſh, but haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> 
               <hi>life; And true faith</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in his firſt Epiſtle <hi>ouercomes the worlde,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.

It is not a true faith for that bings forth ripe fruite, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes, but a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and dead faith without fruite; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaide they beleeue and continue but a time, that is a ſhort time, for true faith alſo ceaſes in the life to come: therefore <note place="margin">2.

We reade of <hi>Domicianus</hi> the Emperor of Rome who made a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that all thoſe that would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip an image ſhould be baniſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon many of his ſubiects, becauſe they would keepe good conſciences fled, the reſt yeelded &amp; became idolaters.

But if there ſhould be a ful purpoſe of the maieſtrate to ſhed the bloud of the Saints, they cannot doe it except &amp; vntil God will ſuffer them, for Chriſt ſaith: <hi>A haire of your head ſhall not periſh without your fathers prouidence;</hi> he can change the kings hart, it may bee we ſhall ſuffer but a few lewd words, as they caled the chriſtians in queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies,

When the word calles on men to keepe the Saboth, they are choaked with theſe things, they haue iourneyes to goe, and other things in their head that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them from obedience. When men are taught by the word to pay their debtes to pay their tithes, to make reſtitution of their wrongs, the world choakes them that they neuer bring forth theſe fruites. Many men know ſuch and ſuch duties are to be done, and they will purpoſe to do them, but ſuch a building, ſuch a purchaſe, marriage of ſuch a daughter, hinders and choakes them ſo as they neuer come at them: but one ſaith; Hell is full of purpoſes, but heauen of performances, ſuch men pretend to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in hearing the worde, but they worſhip their belly, their mony, as <hi>Paul</hi> cals couetous men idolaters, and alſo of voſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> men, hee ſaieth to the <hi>Philipians.</hi> 3.

<pb facs="tcp:177788:60"/> attaine to a little knowledge it is enough, but two of the former ſorts of ground that are naught come ſo far, but thoſe only are good men that heare the worde with their eares, vnderſtand it with their hart, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it with their hands, as our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith in another place: <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it;</hi> they be no good ſubiects that heare the princes lawes &amp; obay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, they be no good ſeruants, that heare their maiſters comandements &amp; do them not, ſo they are no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that heare the worde of God and keepe it not: therefore heare it is ſaid they be good men that bring forth good fruit: if any will aske what fruite, the anſwere is: all ſuch good things as the worde of God dooth require of men, which are generallye ſet downe by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi>

            <p>The perticuler fruites are ſet downe by <hi>Peter,</hi> to be faith, patience, temperance, brotherly kindeneſſe, &amp;c. And by <hi>Iohn</hi> in <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> his firſt Epiſtle, loue and liberallity: and by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 12. and many other places.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177788:61"/>
            <p>For as good men muſt bring foorth fruite, ſo not ſtrange fruite, but ſuch as ſpring from the ſeede of the word of God, that is ſowne in their hearts. The Papiſts will build Abbies, giue money to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Tapers, weare hayre cloath, goe of pilgrimage, and ſeeme to be very deuoute and religious, but theſe bee ſuch things as ſprings from their owne inuention, and not from the word of God. Hipocrites alſo in the Church, will ſeeme to bring foorth fiuite, but it is eyther in doing ſuch things which the worde commands not, or in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them otherwiſe then the worde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them: they will come to church on the Lordes day, becauſe the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, not becauſe the word requires it, they will giue ſomething weekely to the poore, keepe hoſpitalitie at Chriſtmas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhame, ciuilitie and others companie in it mooues them, and not becauſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mooues them in their beſt actions: they want faith in God, loue to men, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in themſelues, that ſhould giue a taſte to their fruites, and without which they are vnſauerie to God. Trees that are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from hotte countries may beare fruite here, but not kindely not timely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not in their naturall ſoyle;
<pb facs="tcp:177788:61"/> ſo of all that heares the word, there neuer growes good fruite in any, but thoſe that haue honeſt and good harts.</p>
            <p>So that thoſe that bring forth bad fruite as it were wilde grapes, thoſe that bring foorth no good fruite, and thoſe that bring foorth fruite that ſeemes to bee good, and yet with bad mindes are all naughty men, onely thoſe are good men that bring forth good fruite indeede with honeſt and good harts, the want of obſeruing this difference hath moued ſome to thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues good Chriſtians when they haue bin hipocrites, theſe men are called good ground, not that they be ſo of themſelues, or as if the word did finde them good, but becauſe they bee by the word and grace of God framed to goodneſſe and made good when the other three ſortes of men, not withſtanding all meanes doe remaine naught.</p>

            <p>And let vs marke for our inſtruction, that of foure ſortes of men which doe heare the worde, there is but one ſorte good, which confirmes our Sauiour Chriſts ſaying, <hi>Math. 22. Many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but fewe are choſen:</hi> Becauſe as he ſaith in another place, <hi>The waye is narrowe that leades vnto life, there bee fewe that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> 
               <hi>findes it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemes by this parable, that in the viſible Church there are many more hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites then true Chriſtians, for not to ſpeake of thoſe that will not heare, thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:177788:62"/> that doe heare, how many are dull and blockiſh, that can conceiue nothing of that which is taught like the high wave grounde? How many bee there that doe vnderſtand ſomething, and ſeeme to bee ſome bodye, that when the leaſt tryall comes ſhrinke and ſhewe they had no conſcience nor grace? Howe many bee there, that are ſo eaten vp of the world, and ouercome of their luſtes, as no doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine can drawe them to dutie, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye to thoſe things that are contrarie to their couetous and voluptuous humors and appetites? And how fewe bee there that doe heare the worde of God and keepe it, with honeſt heartes and good conſciences.</p>
            <p>But yet ſome there bee which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt calles his little flocke, of <note place="margin">Luk. 13. Luk. 19. Acts. 10.</note> which number was <hi>Zacheus</hi> in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Ceſſarya, Dorcas</hi> in <hi>Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, Lydia</hi> in <hi>Philippi,</hi> and of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there might peraduenture bee poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out ſome one or two in this Towne, ſome two or three in that Towne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee cannot ſee many: but thoſe that bee ſuch, they muſt haue the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commendation of good men and good women.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177788:63"/>
            <p>But it is to be noted, that theſe men haue the ſame temptations that the other haue, the deuill ſeekes to take away the ſeede, tyrants threatens them, the worlde intices them, the fleſh prouoakes them, but they reſiſt the deuill, ouercome the world, and ſubdue the fleſh by grace.</p>
            <p>A man would thinke all that heare the word, eſpecially by ſome Miniſters, ſhould become good men: ſo they ſhould if there were not ſomthing to let it, but there bee great corruptions and enemies within and without, that doe blinde and choake men, and carrye them contrarie wayes, onely thoſe become good that haue the ſeede of the worde watred by the grace of God, that it may bee fruitfull, for it is not the plainting of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the watring of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> but God that giues the increaſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore when we heare the worde of God, wee muſt pray for grace, that wee may vnderſtand it, beleeue it, and obey it. Alſo let vs marke, that of thoſe fewe that bee good men, all are not alike good, but there bee degrees of goodneſſe among them, ſome beare fruite 30. fould, ſome 60. fould, and ſome 100. fould, ſome haue hard longer, ſome haue heard better, ſome haue profited more then others, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:177788:63"/> to the meaſure of their knowledge and grace, they beare fruite.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that doe performe ſome good duties, as it were 30. fould with an honeſt heart, be good men, though they be ſhort of others, but doe ſeeke to growe further, and not enuie nor darken thoſe that bee gone before them, and thoſe that performe more duties as it were 60. or 100. fould, be good men, and by compariſon better men, but yet pride not themſelues in their gifts, knowing where they had them, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine nor account them no bodye that come after them, but ſeeke to drawe them on and incourage them.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177788:64"/> things, yet they haue not eares to heare God ſpeake, for there be many that turne away their eares from hearing the lawe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>There bee many that ſtoppe their eares like the deafe Adder,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <note place="margin">Prou.</note> Chriſt ſaith: <hi>And there be many that are dull of hearing,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.

            <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hee that hath an eare let him heare;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Wiſdome is worth the hearing: it is well yee may haue it for the hearing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>Heare this, though many in the Church bee naught, idle and carnall profeſſors, yet there bee good fruites brought forth of a fewe; therefore doe not as ſome doe, iudge all to bee hipocrites becauſe many bee ſuch, for though the Miniſter looſes his labour vpon the moſt, yet he ſees the fruite of his labour in ſome.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> wherein hee hath ſet downe not onely generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine neceſſarie to bee knowne, beleeued and practiſed of all Chriſtians in the other chapters, but alſo inſtructions for perticuler eſtates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of men and women, in the former parte of this chapter. Now the Apoſtle comes to the concluſion of all, as appeares by this worde <hi>ſinally,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, laſt of all I giue you to vnderſtand, that the profeſſion, faith and practiſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will not be holden, performed and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with eaſe, but with much hardneſſe and difficulty, becauſe you haue dangerous and vnweariable enemies that ſeeke your deſtruction, whome you muſt incounter withall and ouercome, that you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſaluation.</p>
            <p>He calles them brethren, becauſe they were the children of God, &amp; of the church as he was, as ſometime he calles the Iewes
<pb facs="tcp:177788:67"/> brethren, becauſe they were of the ſame carnall kindred of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo hee calles the Chriſtian <hi>Gentales</hi> brethren, becauſe they were of the ſame ſpirituall kindred of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and as by the name of brethren he meanes all Chriſtian men, ſo vnder the ſame he comprehends all Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as often in the Scripture the female is included vnder the name of the male, the wife in the husband, the ſiſter in the brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord.</hi> He exhorts them to Chriſtian courage and magnanimitie, in reſpect of the enemies and dangers he will tell them of afterward, a vertue verye neceſſarie not onely for Maieſtrates and Miniſters, who haue to deale with many bad and turbulent perſons, but alſo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian who hath to deale with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, for as cowardize and faint hartedneſſe hath hindred many ſtrong men, ſo forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and reſolution of minde hath beene a great helpe to them that haue beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe weake in warlike affaires.</p>
            <p>When hee ſaith, <hi>Be ſtrong,</hi> hee meanes not corporall ſtrength, for they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no addition to that; but hee meanes ſpirituall ſtrength, as appeareth by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies hee names afterward, and
<pb facs="tcp:177788:67"/> by the ſpirituall armor hee appointes to withſtand them.

            <p>A queſtion alſo may bee asked, if the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians</hi> were able to put on this armour of themſelues?

<pb facs="tcp:177788:78"/> of belles, but theſe neuer came out of Gods armory.</p>
            <p>If this were the armour to withſtand the diuell withall, the Apoſtle forgotte himſelfe that he tould vs not of it, neither here nor elſe where. Againe if this were good armour for that purpoſe, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man might withſtand the diuell aſwell as the godlieſt man: for who cannot make a croſſe on his forhead, weare a crucifixe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, ſprinkle himſelfe with holy water, &amp;c. But that this is not the armour againſt the diuell, appeares hereby, that thoſe who haue beene moſt ſuperſtitious in theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue beene and are the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Sathan and carryed at his pleaſure to Idolatry, hereſie, blaſphemy, adultery, and ſuch haynous ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But the furniture wherewith we muſt withſtand the deuill, is the armour of God, that is preſcribed to vs in this chapter &amp; in the reſt of the Scripture, that is the gifts and graces of regeneration and ſanctification: as ſound knowledge, vpright hartedneſſe, vnfained faith and hope, a iuſt and chaſte minde, an humble ſpirite, ſober and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing affection, and a good conuerſation, it is that which the Apoſtle hath ſet downe in a word, in the 4. chapter, <hi>put on the new</hi>

            <p>And let vs knowe this is none of the leaſt of Sathans temptations, to perſwade men they may doe well enough without them, or with ſome though they ſeeke not for all of them, and to thinke that thoſe that haue them doe no great matters with them.</p>
            <p>How great a temptation of the diuell in the perſon of a woman did <hi>Ioſeph</hi>

            <p>Therefore let ſuch a man knowe it was not ſo much the ſtrength of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as his owne weakeneſſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe that ouerthrewe him, hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace or did not reſiſt; if hee had hee might haue ouercome, for there haue beene men, yea women, that haue ouercome as great temptations as thoſe; and let him tell mee, did hee not vſe his owne handes, his owne eyes, his owne feete, his owne tounge, whereof the diuell hath noe power, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by ſpeciall licenſe or authoritye in

            <p>By this time we ſee cauſe, ſeeing it ſtands vs vpon life and death, to reſiſt the diuell, but ſome man may aske how we ſhould doe it?

            <p>Some may aske how a man ſhould know the temptations of the diuell, from the corrupt motions of our owne nature?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; there is ſuch an affinity &amp; likenes betweene them, as it is hard to diſtinguiſh them: therefore the ſafeſt way is to thinke that we haue to deale with both theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at once, and ſo to be the more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened againſt them; but for a difference let vs know when all euill motion to any ſinne is rayſed, if ſpirituall force be added to draw vs, or ſpiritual ſubtilty to perſwade

            <p>Nowe as both reaſon and religion teacheth that death is certaine, ſo that the time, place and manner of dying is vncertaine: there is no man knowes the time of his death; for although for ſpeciall purpoſe God dooth reueale it to ſome, as the deuill beeing the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome of Gods iudgements, who the Witch rayſed vp in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> toulde <hi>Saul</hi> that to morrowe hee ſhould be with him.

<pb facs="tcp:177788:86"/> Yet ſometimes theſe geſſes doe deceiue them, for God brings downe to the graue, and raiſes vp againe; Therefore no man knowes the daye of his death till the day come, nor the houre of his death till the houre come, but when it doth come, then it dooth as an enemie indeede aſſaile the caſtle of the body, and ranſack euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with terror, and driue the vitall partes from one place to another, til at the length it doth chaſe away the ſoule.</p>

            <p>It is reported of one <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who ſeeing the huge armie of <hi>Zearxes</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a hundred thouſand men, wept; and being asked why he did ſo? becauſe ſayde he within a hundred yeares there ſhall not bee a man left aliue of this great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: as I ſuppoſe this ſmall companie of leſſe then a thouſand men, ſhall meete no more vntill we meete vnto iudgement, as wee ſee many men ſhake hands, purpoſing but a ſhorte abſence, but it prooues their laſt farewell.</p>
            <p>And as the Scripture teaches <hi>Mans life is ſhorte,</hi> ſo that it paſſes ſwiftly away, if
<pb facs="tcp:177788:88"/> the waye bee ſhorte, and the motion ſwift, there can bee no hope of any long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, where the waye is ſhorte, and the motion ſlowe, it may ſtay the longer: as the children of Iſraell were fortye yeares paſſing thorowe the wilderneſſe, becauſe they went ſoftely, which a ſwifte moouer might haue done in fortie dayes: but where the way is ſhorte, and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſwift, it muſt needes come ſoone to an end, ſuch is mans life: it is in the Scripture compared to a Poaſt that haſteth on the Kings buſineſſe; it is compared to a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſhuttle, that ſoone paſſes from one end of the Loome to the other: It is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a thought that runneth ouer the world in a moment: how ſhorte doe wee thinke the time that is paſt? how ſoone doe we thinke a weeke, a month, a yeare to bee gone? Therefore this is a neceſſarie petici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes; Teach vs ſo to number our dayes that wee may applye our heartes to wiſedome.</hi> For what is it by Geometrie to take the bredth and length of the moſt huge things and ſpacious proſpects, and not to meaſure our life, which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth is but a Spanne long. What is it with the cunning Philoſopher to knowe the cauſes and effectes of many things, and
<pb facs="tcp:177788:89"/> neglect to conſider our owne frailety: with the Hiſtoriographer to know and report what other haue done, and to neclect the knowledge of himſelfe; with the lawyer to preſcribe many preceptes, and to forget the common law of nature: with the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metitian to be exact in numbring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the leaſt fractions, and not to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to number our dayes: What is it to liue like doctors in diuers faculties, and to dye God knowes like ſimple men: therefore ſaith <hi>Moſes: Teach vs ſo to number our daies that we may apply our hartes to wiſedome.</hi> For numbring of men, we haue an example in <hi>Dauid:</hi> for numbring of mony we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24</note> in Marchantes: for numbring of ſheepe &amp; oxen it is found among Graſiers, and euery man hath Arithmetick enough to number the things of this life: but there be few that do rightly number their dayes, for where is there one of a hundred that dooth not eyther forget his mortality, or if he doe remember it dooth not proroge his life, and perſwade himſelfe of manye yeares: or if not, yet that dooth apply his hart to wiſedome in his time: therefore although <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe had well learned his leſſon, as appeares by taking ſuch a fit occaſion as I named in the beginning, to
<pb facs="tcp:177788:89"/> fall into this meditation, and as appeares by the diuers ſutable ſpeeches hee vſes in this prayer, yet becauſe hee ſawe the moſt men ſtill ignorant, forgetfull, ſecure and vnwiſe. He prayes God to giue them grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their fraile and mortall eſtate, and wiſely to make vſe of it.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, what neede we ſeeke any further? <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe in the 10. verſe hath ſet downe the number of our dayes, where he ſaith; <hi>The dayes of a man are threeſcore yeares and ten:</hi> but wee muſt marke, there he compares the ſhortneſſe of mans life in his time, with the length of mans life in the dayes of his fathers, who liued ſeauen hundred, eight hundred and nine hundred yeares, and now the age or life of man was but threeſcore yeares and ten, or foure ſcore; as <hi>Ieremie</hi> propheſied, that the Iſralites ſhould be in captiuitie in <hi>Babell</hi> ſeuentie yeares, that is a whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: and yet in the tenth verſe, in thoſe wordes <hi>Moſes</hi> meant not to ſet downe the certaine terme of euery mans life, for then hee needed not to haue made this petition; <hi>Teach vs to number our dayes:</hi> but hee had experience as wee haue, that ſome dyed in their infancie, ſome in their childhood, ſome in their
<pb facs="tcp:177788:90"/> middle age, and ſome liue till that full terme, then they dye: yet whereas one Apple hangs on the Tree tell it be mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and falles of it ſelfe, there be a hundred that are broken off with violent hands and violent windes.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe a man ſhould liue till hee bee threeſcore yeares and tenne, halfe that time is ſpent in ſleeping, which may be ſubtracted from the groſe ſumme, and then there remaines but thirtie and fiue yeares, whereof wee may deduct fifteene yeeres of our childhood, wherein we are rather troubleſome then profitable, and not fitte to doe any great ſeruice, eyther to God or men, and ſo there remaines but twentie yeares: now take from that the time that is ſpent in wickedneſſe, the time that is ſpent in idleneſſe, the time that is ſpent in ſuperfluous eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other neceſſary things, and then conſider how little time remaines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee applye our heartes to wiſedome, euen of thoſe who liue threeſcore yeares and tenne, how much leſſe of thoſe who dye ſooner? But this was but a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that a man may liue ſo long, for Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaythe; <hi>A man cannot tell</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> 
               <hi>whether hee ſhall liue tell to morrowe.</hi> Now
<pb facs="tcp:177788:90"/> the time that is paſt is gone, and cannot bee called againe, (therefore Time was wonte to bee painted with hayre before and balde behinde:) the time that is to come, is none, and cannot bee preſumed vppon; (Therefore it is ſayde of a wiſe man, hee woulde make no promiſe for to morrowe:) ſo that wee haue none but the preſent time to applye our hearts to wiſedome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> hath doone what hee can in this Pſalme, to inſtructe all men in the knowledge of the breuitie of their life, and vncertaine certaintye of their death, and prayes to God in theſe wordes to teach them further and better: for all that is ſayde in the Scripture, aſwell in this, as anye other matter, ſhall bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, except God doth teache the hart aſwell as the eare; for it is not the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the watring of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> but God that giues the increaſe. Nowe wee haue ſeene his peticion for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of our dayes, let vs come to his reaſon, that wee may applye our hearts to wiſedome.</p>
            <p>He deſires God not onely to teach vs to number our dayes, but ſo to teache it vs, that we may apply our harts to wiſedome,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:91"/> and not to folly: Men are in extremities of euery ſide; ſome all their deſire is to dye and to be gone: ſome all their deſire is to liue and neuer to dye: ſome againe know they muſt away, and are content to tarrie their time, but doe not ſeeke for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſtudy to liue well while they bee heere. There be ſome, who although their liues be ſhorte and too ſhorte if they were beſt imployed, to become ſo wiſe as they ſhould, yet by laying violent hands of themſelues doe make them ſhorter, but this is not wiſedome but fooliſhneſſe. In the ſixt commaundement it is ſaid; <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> one obſerues vpon that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not added, <hi>thy neighbour,</hi> hee meanes alſo thy ſelfe. If it be a great ſinne for a man to kill another, it is a greater ſinne to kill himſelfe: againe, life is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, and death is a part of the curſſe. Now a man may not thruſt from him the bleſſing of God, and pull vpon himſelfe the curſſe: God and not we doth appoint the time of our birth, ſo God and not wee muſt appoint the time of our death.</p>
            <p>No good man that wee read of in the Scripture, neither <hi>Iob, Dauid, Lazarus,</hi> nor any other, though they were in great
<pb facs="tcp:177788:91"/> extremitie did kill themſelues, but onely wicked men and reprobates, as <hi>Saul, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitophell</hi> and <hi>Iudas. Cleombrotus</hi> a Heathen man, hearing of the immortallity of the ſoule, killed himſelfe, that hee might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine immortality, beeing ignorant that there is immortalitie in hell aſwell as in heauen: and <hi>Lucretia</hi> and certaine Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then women killed themſelues that they might not be defiled with Souldiers, not knowing that the bodye is not defiled, if the minde bee chaſte, and yet if it were vncertaine, adulterie ſhould not haue been ſo much feared as certaine murder, they ſhould not ſo much haue feared a ſinne that might bee repented, as a ſinne that could not bee repented, becauſe time was cut off, homiſide hath alwayes beene ſo deteſtable a thing in the Church, that ſuch haue beene denyed Chriſtian buriall, that where moſt men are with-houlden from ſinne by the feare of death, ſeeing they doe not feare death, they might feare ſomething after death, that is, the reproche of thoſe that liue. There was one ſayde to his ſonne who had often theſe wordes in his mouth; I would I were dead: I prethe (ſaith hee) learne firſt to knowe what it is to liue. Some in croſſes will ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:92"/> I would I were as deepe vnder the earth as I am high, but waye firſt wherefore God hath placed you vppon the earth, and cauſed you to growe ſo high as yee be, and what hee dooth require of you: and waye whether yee haue done it or no, and what rewarde abideth for you, if you haue not; and then conſider whether it be not fitter to learne to be wiſe and to liue better firſt.</p>
            <p>Some againe, as I ſayde, are in the other extremitie, and would liue ſtill and neuer dye; many olde men that haue lyued long already would not dye, as appeares by marrying young women, and building new houſes; but ſuch men haue neyther right reaſon to conſider of the eſtate of this life, nor true faith to conſider of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the life to come, this is a life full of miſerie, &amp; the next to the children of God, is a life full of felicitie. It is ſaid of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus,</hi> that euery day hee wept, and beeing asked the reaſon, he anſwered; Becauſe the world was full of miſerie. The <hi>Thratians</hi> at the birthe of their children euer wepte, their reaſon was, becauſe they were borne to miſerie; and at the death of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren euer reioyſed, becauſe they were freed from miſery, as they thought: <hi>Paul</hi>

From the Cradle to the graue wee are toſte with troubleſome things; and if in our lyfe we meete with anye profitable or pleaſante thinges, they ſoone vaniſhe awaye, at the leaſt the pleaſure of them.

The Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues from the 23. verſe, to the end of the Chapter: wherein our Sauiour Chriſt by parabolicall ſpeeches, for our capacitie, ſets forth ſuch things as elſe we could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. For where it is ſaid, the ritch man being in hell ſhould lift vp his eyes and ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and ſhould ſpeake to him with his tongue, and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould heare him and anſwere him againe; Theſe things muſt be vnderſtood after the maner of Parables, for the ritch mans body was not in hell, but in the graue: it is ſaid hee was buryed, onely his ſoule was in hell: therefore hee had not the vſe or gouernement of his eyes to ſee, of his eares to heare, nor of his tongue to ſpeake,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:99"/> neither were the bodyes of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in heauen, that they ſhould heare the ritch man, or ſpeake vnto him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rehearſall of corporall ſight, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſaying, is after the manner of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, for our capacitie and inſtruction, that we might know how the eſtate of the good and bad ſhall differ in the next life, from that it is in this life: how they that haue heere ſerued God, reuerenced his worde, loued their brethren, fathfully done their duties, and paciently borne their croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhall in the next life be comforted and rewarded, and thoſe that haue here diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured God, contemned his word, neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their brethren, and not done nor ſuffred ſuch things as God would haue them, ſhall in the next life bee perpetually puniſhed, and in vaine ſhall deſire the leaſt mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their miſerie.</p>
            <p>The drift of our Sauiour Chriſt in this example, is to diſcourage the <hi>Phariſes</hi> from their wickedneſſe, or elſe in this ritch man to behold their doome, &amp; to incourage his diſciples in vertue and goodneſſe, and ſo in this poore man to beholde their reward.</p>
            <p>The ritch man is ſet in the firſt place, becauſe in this life he had the preferment; and he is purpoſely deſcribed to haue the
<pb facs="tcp:177788:99"/> world at will for the backe and the belly, he had aſmuch as hart could wiſh; for the backe, hee was cloathed with Purple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a colour both coſtly and goodly for the ſight, and fine linnen ſofte and eaſie next the skinne, for feeling for the belly hee fared deliciouſlie, that is, hee had many pleaſant and daintie diſhes of meate, and that not once or twice a weeke, but euery day: hee had alſo diuers other things anſwerable and ſuteable to theſe; as a ſtately houſe, for it is ſaid, <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay at his gate or gate houſe, and might not haue acceſſe to his inner building, he had alſo diuers ſeruants to waite vpon him, for it is ſaide, no man gaue releefe to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> neyther the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nor any of his men: likewiſe he had a kennell of Houndes for Hunting, or Spanniels for Hawking, for it is ſayde the Dogges came and licked <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſores: but our Sauiour Chriſt ſpecially noteth his apparell and dyet, to ſhewe his vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that hauing aboundance of the things that <hi>Lazarus</hi> wanted, beeing hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye and colde hee would not releeue him.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the Holy-ghoſt is not to condemne the vſe of coſtly apparell and pleaſant meate, as ſome peraduenture may
<pb facs="tcp:177788:100"/> thinke, for if we could haue heard it ſayde of this ritch man, as it is ſayde of ritch <hi>Iob, That he ſed the hungrie, and clothed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> wee ſhould haue had no cauſe to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like his aboundance, for apparrell and that of all colours is ordained of God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our nakedneſſe, but alſo for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; meate and drinke of all kindes is ordained of God, not onely for our empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but alſo for our daintineſſe, not onely for neceſſitie, but alſo for ſolemnitie; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this man hauing no grace, no doubt did abuſe his aboundance, to ſurfetting and gluttony; therefore hee is commonly called the ritch glutton, which ſinne is much ſpoken againſt in other places of Scripture, and muſt bee auoyded of vs as that which will bring vs not onely to other ſinnes, but to condemnation, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith: and therefore one ſaith; No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> though of all other creatures the diuell did take ſuch delight in the Hogs, becauſe they are ſo like his cormorants. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt condemnes his vnmercifulnes, that though hee had plenty of meanes, yet he had no minde to doe <hi>Lazarus</hi> good.</p>
            <p>This man was a carnall man, that did onely feede his body, and cared not for the foode of the ſoule; he regarded not <hi>Moſes</hi>

But that men might be mooued to come out of the broad waye that leades to deſtruction, and to take heede of ſuch wickedneſſe; let vs conſider that before hee dwelt in a ſtately and goodly Pallace, now hee is caſt into a deepe and darke pit or dungeon: before hee was accompanied with diuers braue perſons and gallants, now his companions are the deuill and his angels: before he fed of dainty diſhes, and now his meate is fire and Brimſtone: before hee liued in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith to him afterward, but now thou art tormented.

If theſe be ſo fearefull wherein the iuſtice of God is ſhewed but partly, what are thoſe where the iuſtice of God is ſhewed perfectlie? Therefore is the day of iudgement to the wicked, called the day of wrath, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the iuſt iudgement of God: but the greeuouſneſſe of it is not all, the perpetuity of it is more then all; therefore it is called the euerlaſting burning. The name of perpetuall impriſonment is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing in this world, which yet endes at the death of the Prince, or of the partie, but this worde <hi>neuer,</hi> breakes a mans heart. If all the Arithmetricians in the worlde were ſet a worke all their life to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but number, and in the ende all their numbers ſhould bee ſet together, yet they could come nothing neere the length of time that the wicked ſhall be tormented in hell. One vſes this ſimilye; If a man ſhould euery thouſand yeare ſhed but one teare, vntill it did ariſe to as much water as is in the whole ſea, yet it would haue an end; but this, then the which what is more fearefull or terrible to ſpeake or thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall neuer haue end. When a man is to

               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I can beare:</hi> yet hee muſt beare it. If men doe not feare this, what will they feare? if men doe not flye this, what will they flie? what is more ſtrange from reaſon, then for a man to flye euery little danger in this world, and not to flye this great danger of condemnation in the world to come. Yet if theſe things were doubtfull and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, it were the leſſe maruell though men did liue in ſinne, but when men know them, beleeue them, and profeſſe the trueth of them, what madneſſe, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, that they doe not ſtudie to auoide them: Tell mee O witleſſe man, ſaith one, what gaine is ſo great that can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile this loſſe? what pleaſure is ſo ſweete that can recompence this paine? looke of this ritche man, who ſometime ſported himſelfe in his ſinnes, and forgat himſelfe of his duties; now hee lyes crying out of his paine, and deſiring releaſe of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and cannot haue it: hee may bee compared to a Kings ſumpter Horſe, who

So ſuch wicked men that are all their life braue and wealthie, but when they dye, thoſe things are laide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and they are turned into the priſon of hell, hauing nothing left them but their galled conſcience.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid being in hell in torments, <hi>Hee lift vp his eyes and ſawe Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> all that follow to the end of the chapter, as I ſaide in the beginning, are Parabolicall ſpeeches ſeruing to amplifie the miſerie of this man, for it was a great increaſe of his torments to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo exalted, and himſelfe ſo caſt downe. As it was a great vexation to <hi>Haman</hi> to ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſitte<note place="margin">Heſter.</note> on the Kings Horſe in royall apparrell, and himſelfe to hould his Stirrop. It did much increaſe this mans torment, that hee muſt begge of <hi>Lazarus</hi> that had beene his begger, and that a droppe of water which was a leſſe almes then the other had beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of him and could not haue it: it was a great increaſe of his torment to heare of his faults now, when hee could not amend them, and to heare of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb facs="tcp:177788:114"/> that had ſhewed him the waye to preuent this miſerie, and he did not regard them.</p>
            <p>It was a great increaſe of his miſerie to heare that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was comforted, when hee was tormented: it was a great increaſe of his torment, to heare that the barre of Gods eternall predeſtination had ſo bound him, that hee could neuer bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from his condemnation, and that Gods election had ſetled <hi>Lazarus</hi> in a permanent and happy condition. This did greatly increaſe his miſerie, that in his life time he had many ſeruants at commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and now no body would doe any thing for him, no not the begger: in this life he might haue riden or gone whether he would; but now hee was bound hand and foote and could goe no whether: in this life hee might haue taught his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and friends any thing, but now hee could doe them no good. In this life if hee would haue made an earneſt prayer to God for a greater matter hee might haue had it, but nowe it was too late, the time of mercie was paſt, the time of iuſtice was come: therefore ſaith the Scripture; <hi>To daye if yee will heare his voyce harden not your hearts:</hi> it was to daye with <hi>Pharao</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:115"/> when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> preached to him; it was to morrowe when he was drowned in the Red ſea: It is to day with men while they liue here and may repent of their ſinnes and amend their liues; it will bee to morrowe when they are gone from hence: for as the day of death leaues vs, ſo the day of doome ſhall finde vs, as we ſee in this mans example.

And it is an vnworthy thing in a Maieſtrate, when a cauſe comes before him againſt a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon perſon, to condemne it, but if it be againſt a kinſman or friend to alter the caſe. We read of a Maieſtrate whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went to ſit in iudgement would bid his friends farewell, ſome looke to the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of men, he is a proper man ſpare him, but God delights in no mans legs.

            <p>Some Officers looke not to God but to Mammon, not how they may giue euery man his owne, but how they may make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens their owne: not how they may diſpatch cauſes rightly and commodiouſly for the people, but how they may eyther releaſe or linger cauſes for their owne commoditie, but it is ſaid <hi>Thou ſhalt take us rewardes:</hi> and the Maieſtrate ſhould ſay to him that offers him a bribe, what wouldeſt thou put out my eyes?

Many will alledge the examples of the fathers to follow them in their vices; but their faultes are ſet downe to ſhew the frailty of man, that wee may take heede of them, and to ſhew the mercy of God, that wee might

            <p>Therefore when we will follow any man or woman, wee muſt looke the thing bee good that we follow, ſecondly that it bee good for vs, for that may bee good in one, that is not in another, as it was a good thing in <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his ſonne in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe he had a commaundement for it; but it was euill in other that did it without warrant: thirdly wee muſt looke the thing be good when we doe follow it. The fathers did well in worſhipping God, on the mountaines and highe places, but when God had erected his Temple they did euill that did ſo. The Papiſtes do much vrge the examples of the fathers, but they meane <hi>Auguſtine, Ierome, Barnard</hi> &amp; thoſe: but they ſpeake not of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob</hi> and thoſe: but if the authority of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould mooue vs, then thoſe that are moſt ancient &amp; do moſt deſerue the name of fathers, muſt mooue moſt. Againe the Papiſtes ſpeake of the vertues of good men and women, to mooue vs to worſhip them, and not to follow them, but if they be vſed to that end, they ceaſe to bee examples, that are for immitation, and not for adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb facs="tcp:177788:141"/> when we ſpeake of this or that vertue, ſome ſay theſe are good things if we could practiſe them, why <hi>Abraham</hi> was faithful, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was chaſt, <hi>Iob</hi> was patient, <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was louing, the <hi>Centurion</hi> was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was charitable, <hi>Sara</hi> was meeke, why ſhould not we.

            <p>The faſhion that the Apoſtle would haue Chriſtian women to followe, is an olde faſhion, Gentlewomen are euer ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newe faſhions, but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Apparrell your ſelues with that that Sara did, and reſt in it, there is no better.

            <p>If any ſhall obiect <hi>Sara</hi> had outwarde Iewels and coſtlye things, it is true, ſo may her daughters according as their calling and habilitie will ſuffer, but ſhee did not accounte thoſe thinges for

            <p>Some women that ſet their mindes of gewgawes, when they would defend any fooliſh or monſtrous attire, they ſay it is the faſhion, it may be the faſhion of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and prophane women but the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sara</hi> muſt looke to the faſhion of holy women.</p>
            <p>The want of religion in many women is ſeene in their apparrell, their harts being as hollow as their verdugales, their mindes being as light as their feathers, and their thoughtes as changeable as their faſhions, <hi>Peter</hi> hauing praiſed, and preſſed this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of meekenes, he ſaith: Holy women and <hi>Sara</hi> did weare it, and it made all the reſt the more comely, for it made them ſubiect to their husbandes, as <hi>Sara</hi> obayed her husband and called him ſir: the wante of meekeneſſe hinders ſubiection, for the wordes of the mouth and workes of the handes, followe the motions of the minde, if the affections bee diſordred,

<pb facs="tcp:177788:146"/> Chapter, but he telles them heere there is<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 9</note> cauſe of weeping. There was cauſe they ſhould weepe for their ſinnes, becauſe they abuſed their riches, letting them ruſt and Motheate, when the poore had neede of them, and becauſe they defrauded and oppreſſed the poore, yea becauſe they killed the iuſt, letting them ſtarue for hunger and colde: but becauſe they were hardned in their ſinnes, he willes them to weepe for their miſeries, not for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries they were preſently in, for they now wallowed in wealth: But for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie that ſhould come on them, when they ſhould giue account how they had vſed their talent, as yee may ſee in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> of the vnprofitable ſeruant, and in the<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> example of the ritch glutton. It were a merry worlde if it might goe alwayes with ſuch men as it dooth now, but they ſhall change a coppy as wee ſaye. Now becauſe theſe men were ſecure, and thought of no afterclappes he calles them to conſider their miſery in time to come, for where ſinne goes before, if repentance comes not in the middeſt, diſtruction ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the end.</p>
            <p>Where hee biddes them <hi>howle,</hi> the worde importes ſuch a lamentation as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
<pb facs="tcp:177788:146"/> from the certaine expectation of the iudgement of God, as it is ſaide of <hi>Eſay</hi> when hee ſawe himſelfe depriued both of the birth-right and bleſſing, hee<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> cryed with a bitter crye out of meaſure.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes ſtrange to ſome, that a man that is hayle in his bodye, hath money in his purſe, many ſuites of rayment to his backe, and diuers diſhes of meate on his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not a few poore men at comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ſhould be bidden <hi>howle,</hi> but if ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Tour ritches are corrupt:</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſhewes the cauſe why ſuch great miſerie ſhould come vpon them, becauſe they did couetouſly heape vp ritches, and niggardly keepe them, rather ſuffering the poore to periſh, then to beſtow them vpon their needy brethren.</p>
            <p>Some haue Golde (as they will ſaye,) haue ſeene no Sunne thus long, yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they will change a peece of Golde the poore ſhall ſtarue, they haue thus many gownes, and thus many paire
<pb facs="tcp:177788:147"/> of ſheetes, but rather then they will depart with any of them, the poore ſhall goe and lie naked, and when they haue filled their bagges with golde, and their cheſtes with rayment, yet their hartes are not full. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that coueteth ſiluer ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſiluer;</hi> and therefore will rather fill more bagges and cofers, then empty any to fill the poores bellies. One ſaith: The ritch man in the Goſpel that ſaid he would<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 16</note> make his barnes bigger, he had barnes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before if he would haue ſeene it, for ſaith he: the bellies of the poore are the barnes of the ritch.</p>
            <p>In that he ſaith: <hi>Your ritches are corrupt,</hi> it ſhewes the nature of theſe outwarde things that they are ſubiect to periſhing, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>They are ſubiect to</hi>

            <p>Some may thinke themſelues without danger of this threatning, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:177788:147"/> let not their golde and garmentes ruſt and Moth-eate for they put foorth their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and haue little in their purſe, they haue but one ſuite of apparrell to their backe: but though they put foorth their mony, if they put it not foorth to that vſe they ſhould, if their garmentes periſh not for want of wearing, if the poore pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for wante of clothing it is all one, if men vſe not their ritches rightly, they ſhall accuſe them iuſtly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yee haue heaped vp treaſures for the laſt dayes.</hi> This is the vanity of worldly men, they thinke their ritches ſhall ſerue them and continue till the worldes ende, but though theeues and wormes ſhould not conſume them; yet they will periſh of themſelues before that daye: therefore in the firſt Chapter hee hath compared rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to Graſſe, and although men knowe in iudgement they are vncertaine, yet their affection, and practiſe is as their ſhould bee no ende of them, and although manye will confeſſe themſelues to bee mortall, yet they will liue and deale as if they ſhould neuer dye. In the example of the ritch man, that built his barnes bigger, and ſaide to his ſoule take thyne eaſe, for thou haſt foode laide vp for many yeares, wee

            <p>The poore are defrauded of their wages diuers wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When ritch men giue the poore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for their worke.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they giue not the poore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient wages, but will haue them doe two penny-worth or three halfe-penny-worth for a penny; as <hi>Jacob</hi> when he had ſerued for faire <hi>Rahel,</hi> hee was rewarded with bleare-eyed <hi>Leah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When they change the wages of the poore, giuing them not the ſame but worſe, not money but bad or deare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When they keepe poore mens wages long in their handes, or longer then they ſhould to their owne aduantage, and the poores diſaduantage all theſe wayes, not onely ſome other ritch men, but Clothiers doe defraude the poore at this day: ſome haue many an houres worke for nothing: ſome doe change their wages, and paye them with bad or deare commodities, ſome doe keepe their money long in their
<pb facs="tcp:177788:149"/> handes and driue them to extremities, the moſt of them, I feare all, doe giue the poore too little wages for their worke.</p>
            <p>There bee three rules of equity, that are reſpected in giuing of wages.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The firſt our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe ſpeakes of, ſaying: <hi>Whatſoeur yee would that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12</note> 
               <hi>men ſhould doe to you, euen ſo doe yee to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of: <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteale no more,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 28.</note> but let him labour with his handes, the thing that is good, that he may eate his own bread and giue to him that needeth or that cannot labour.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The third rule is that common rule of equity, that not onely religion hath taught Chriſtians, but that the light of nature hath taught men of all other trades.</p>
            <p>Firſt let vs ſee the equity of theſe rules that wee may iudge whether we be bound to them or no, and then ſee if we be ruled by them.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, it is our Sauiour Chriſtes owne rule, who hauing interpreted the lawe, and preſcribed many duties of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in perticuler, he ſets downe this generall rule, whatſoeuer yee would by the light of nature, not by the corruption of nature, for ſo thorow a corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:150"/> and when he is in a temptation, ſome man at ſome time would haue another to kill him as <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſome man thorow a corrupt affection would haue another too much to reſpect him, as the ſonnes of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus:</hi> but whatſoeuer yee would by the light of nature, whereby a man doth deſire any thing that is fitte for him to deſire, and that is fitte another man ſhould doe to him, euen ſo doe you to another: as if our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould ſay; Wouldeſt thou if thou wert poore haue another to releeue thee? then thou that art ritch releeue the poore: wouldeſt thou if thou wert a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer haue anſwerable wages paid thee? then thou that haſt thy worke done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the labourer: yee ſee this rule cannot be excepted againſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the rule of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where hee<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> calles poore men from ſtealing and euill meanes, and commaunds them to labour and vſe good meanes to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo that if hee haue his limmes, his health, and cunning to doe the worke that the place where hee liues affoordes, and dooth dilligentlye labour in his calling: I take it wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:177788:150"/> man may and muſt by his labour ſuſtaine himſelfe, and be helpfull to others.</p>
            <p>But it will bee obiected, if hee haue a charge hee cannot doe it, I anſwere, wee muſt ſuppoſe if hee hath children hee hath a wife, that is a ſecond perſon to ioyne with him in labour: now the Scripture appointing men and women able of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, no other meanes but labour, wee muſt ſuppoſe that they may by their labour maintaine their children while they be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, vntill they bee alſo able to labour, which commonlye is not many, nor any long time: And thus it is among the Dutch folkes, who doe ſo labour and bring vp their children to worke that thereby they are ſuſteined.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude from this rule of the Apoſtle, that if anye cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine themſelues ordinarilye, for I ſpeake not but that there may bee ſome ſecret curſſe or puniſhment of God vpon ſome man; As the Prophet <hi>Hagge</hi> ſayth in his<note place="margin">Hag. 1.</note> firſt Chapter, <hi>They ſhall e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rne wages and put it in a bottomleſſe bagge,</hi> but otherwiſe thoſe that bee ſuch able perſons of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as I haue ſpoken of before, if they cannot ſuſtaine themſelues, if they wante not woorke, nor a dilligente hande in
<pb facs="tcp:177788:151"/> their worke, then it muſt follow they haue not an equall recompence for their worke.</p>
            <p>The third rule as I ſaid, is that equitie which is followed not onely by religious men by the light of religion, but alſo by thoſe that haue no religion by the light of nature of all other trades, and that in the time and place where wee liue now, wee knowe that by nature men will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly giue with the moſt wages, but with the leaſt, and if ſome one or ſome fewe would, yet the multitude will not; therfore this rule alſo cannot iuſtly bee excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, eſpecially if the circumſtances bee weyed, and things be made proporciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Therfore I thinke it euident, that theſe rules muſt direct vs in the matter of giuing wages, and that all men ſhould examine their practiſe therein by them: therefore now wee will conſider whether Clothiers whome I doe ſpecially indeauour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and reforme by this treatiſe, doe in their wages follow theſe rules or no. If any ſhould inquire why I picke out Clothiers rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other to ſpeake of, I anſwer, becauſe when I preached this ſermon, my auditory conſiſted of them, &amp; becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the greatneſſe, variety, &amp; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their opreſſions, with the multitude
<pb facs="tcp:177788:151"/> of thoſe that are oppreſſed, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that follows therevpon, I take it to be one of the greateſt ſinnes that in our age hath beene committed in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie againſt the ſecond table of the lawe, alſo becauſe ſome Clothiers haue ſhewed deafe eares in hearing it, vnwiſe tongues in ſpeaking of it, I would ſee if they haue my better eyes to read it.</p>
            <p>But in ſpeaking of this matter, I would not be taken to ſpeake againſt the trade of Cloathing, which I confeſſe is a neceſſary, a commendable and profitable trade, and the eſtate of our country conſidered, is in diuers reſpects to be preferred before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other trades. Alſo I would not be taken to ſpeake againſt the perſons of any that doe profeſſe and followe this trade, much leſſe my owne neighbours, but againſt the common iniuſtice that is crept into that trade Further, I would not be taken to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all Clothiers this way, ſeeing there be many that I know not, as I will not euery way excuſe any that I know. Finally, as I appeale to God that I haue no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in writing hereof, then to further his righteouſneſſe and ritch mens happineſſe, then to diſcharge my owne dutye, and to helpe the poores miſery: ſo I wiſhe them
<pb facs="tcp:177788:152"/> whome this matter concernes, to be of the ſame minde in reading and practiſing of it, and therefore to conſider whether they doe cut, not their cloath, but the wages of thoſe that make their cloath, by the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand or rules aforeſaid, or no.</p>
            <p>For the firſt rule, I ſuppoſe Clothiers will not ſay in paying their worke-folkes wages they doe as they would be done to; if ſome will ſay ſo, let it be tryed by God and the countrie, when they haue read this diſcourſe, and in the meane ſeaſon let this reaſon diſprooue it, that Clothiers do complaine of their Markets, and finde faulte with their Marchants, when their paines is much leſſe, their gaines much greater, and their vſage much better then their poore worke-folkes.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond rule, that thoſe that worke vnder them ſhould by their labour ſuſtaine themſelues, and helpe thoſe that cannot worke, and therfore their wages ſhould be anſwerable that they might do ſo. Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cannot ſay they follow this rule, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches, that moſt of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, except ſuch as haue ſome other meanes to liue, or be of ſome rare hardnes of body and reſolution of minde, to worke night and day, and be without charge, are
<pb facs="tcp:177788:152"/> ſo farre from being able to ſuſtaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by their labour, that they muſt bee ſuſteined by others, they are ſo farre from being able to giue a penny to thoſe that cannot labor, that except ſuch as be before excepted, they bee moſt of them beggers and haue need to take reliefe.</p>
            <p>For the third rule, which is the common equitie that all men of other trades follow in giuing of wages, whether Carpenters, Maſons, Thatchers, labourers, or any other, a workman that workes by the day hath at the leaſt foure pence a day and meate and drinke. But Clothiers goe not this way to worke to finde their workefolkes meate &amp; drinke, as in time paſt, they haue found out a cheaper way, therefore the compariſon muſt be where there is no meate &amp; drinke giuen: therefore let it bee conſidered, that in other trades thoſe that worke for wages without meate &amp; drinke, the ſorieſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that in the ſhorteſt dayes hath eight pence a day, and ſo as the workman is better and the dayes longer he hath nine pence, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pence, &amp; twelue pence a day; now let vs ſee whether clothiers folow this rule.</p>
            <p>And firſt to begin with their Spinners, who commonly are women take not the ſorieſt but the skilfulleſt &amp; the diligenteſt,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:153"/> and they cannot earne in Clothiers worke, I meane thoſe Clothiers that are called Blew men, aboue three pence or foure pence a day, both towards their owne find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Wheele and Cardes, that doe weare much in that kinde of worke, marke that I ſay foure pence a day, which is the greateſt earning of a Spinner in blewe worke that I can learne, that they may bring no inſtance againſt me. And marke that I compare the beſt Spinners with the worſte labourers in other trades, and then ſee the difference, the other hauing eight pence a day in other trades, and theſe haue but foure pence. What difference is there then, if you compare the ſorrie Spinner which can earne not three pence nor two pence a day, with the ſorie labourer which hath eight pence a day, or the beſt labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer which hath twelue pence and ten pence a day, with the beſt Spinner that hath but three pence or foure pence. If any Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould ſay that ſome Spinners wil earne more then three pence or foure pence a day, I diſproue it by the confeſſion of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers themſelues, who ſay, that Spinners and Weauers earne their penny very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and by the practiſe of all ſuch women who will refuſe to Spinne and chooſe to
<pb facs="tcp:177788:153"/> burle, for which worke Clothiers giue but three pence, &amp; in the beſt places but foure pence a daye, this the Clothiers deny not, but they defend it, and obiect that they ſet the poores children on worke alſo, it is true, elſe how ſhould they make ſo much cloth, if they had not many hands about it, but children haue but childrens wages, they haue ſo much for a pound, or they ſpin thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> many knots for a peny, according to which rate the mothers can earne but two pence, three pence or foure pence at the moſt, what thinke wee can the children earne. Further, Clothiers obiect there muſt bee a difference put betweene men and women, this I will graunt them, yet women are as artificiall and profitable in thoſe kindes of workes for the Clothier, as men could be if they were brought vp vnto it; but they wil further preſſe this obiection, and ſay; As maide ſeruants haue leſſe wages then men ſeruants, by the ſame reaſon other women ſhould haue leſſe wages then men: but though maidſeruants haue leſſe wages, yet they haue better dyet &amp; haue eaſier worke and weares leſſe apparel, but many women that worke vnder Clothiers in ſpinning &amp; carding, and breaking of Woll, doe toyle their armes, and foyle their clothes aſmuch
<pb facs="tcp:177788:154"/> as many men of other trades, and yet haue ſo much leſſe wages, as I haue ſayde, the ſame women when they worke not with Clothyers but with other men, in other worke haue better wages, if they keepe a woman in child-bed they haue three pence a daye and meate and drinke, if they make Haye they haue three pence or two pence a day and meate and drinke, if ſhee reape Corne, ſhee hath foure pence and ſixe pence a day and meate and drinke, thoſe that carrie Tankardes in London can earne ſixe pence and ſeauen pence a daye, all which are double the wages they haue in Clothiers worke, as afore is ſaide: yea if the ſame women doe worke with Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelues in other buſineſſe, whether thoſe before named, or any other, which yet are not ſo profitable to them as the workers of their trade, they giue them ſuch wages as other men doe: why ſhould they that would bee thought to haue the moſt Gentleman-like trade of others, bee the moſt baſe and beggerlie in their wages of all others? and why ſhould they giue for the worke of their trade, which is more gainefull to them then any other buſineſſe leſſe wages then for anye other worke? But let it be granted, that the womans ſexe
<pb facs="tcp:177788:154"/> ſhould haue leſſe wages then men, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted that there ſhould be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence more then halfe in halfe betweene them, when the woman ſpendes as much time, takes aſmuch paines, and dooth as profitable worke as men of other trades, as I haue ſaide afore, but I will leaue the women that worke vnder Clothiers, and come to the men.</p>
            <p>And firſt for their Weauers, their wages is thus much or ſo much for a Cloth, as it is finer or courſer: but by the way marke that the Clothier ſets the price, wheras in other trades men ſet the price of their owne worke, and other men aske their workmen either when they begin or when they haue done, what they ſhall paye, but Clothiers will ſet downe what theſe that worke ſhall haue, as if one man ſhould beare two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons both of the buyer and ſeller.</p>
            <p>Now the wages that the Weauers haue they deuide into three partes, two parts are appointed to two men that Weaue the cloath, the third part is allowed for a boye that windeth the Quilles, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the charge and reperation of the Loombes and lightes. Now many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe complaine, and that not ſodenly, but often and aduiſedly, not bad perſons
<pb facs="tcp:177788:155"/> that care not what they ſay, but ſober and honeſt men, that when they recken the dayes that they be about their cloath, and proportion their wages that they haue for weauing it, it growes but to ſixe pence a day, and that it is as often but fiue pence and foure pence a day, when their worke is at the worſt, then it is eyther eight pence or ſeauen pence a day when their worke is at the beſt, although as the order of theſe workemen is, they continue at worke from the bell to the bell, from foure of the clock in the morning, till eight of the clocke at night, which is three houres in a day long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then other men of other trades doe worke, that haue greater wages, as I haue ſhewed, which time in the morning and euening conſider, if it leſſon not Weauers wages almoſt a fourth part, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, and ſee if Weauers haue much more wages then Spinners and Burkers that are women, and ſo if they haue any more then halfe ſo much wages then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workemen haue of other trades, in which reſpect I knowe ſome Weauers haue wiſhed themſelues Taylors that haue foure pence a daye and meate and drinke, and I knowe ſome that haue leaft their Weauing wherein they ſerued a prentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:155"/> and haue taken a Spade and a hooke, and I knowe ſome very skilfull in Weauing Clothiers worke, that haue left it and become learners to Weaue Dutch worke.</p>
            <p>But Clothiers obiect, though this bee true, yet it is tollerable, becauſe Weauers ſtroy not ſo much apparell as other trades men doe, and their worke not beeing ſo ſtirring, they ſpende not ſo much meate and drinke as others doe.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to the firſt parte of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection: If ſome men of other trades ſtroye more, others doe ſtroye leſſe, as Taylors, Shoomakers and Ioyners: but I ſee not but Weauers conſidering the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their hoaſe behinde, and their dublets afore, doe ſtroye as much as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers: if there bee any difference, the oddes of their wages for one daye, will mende the labourers ſhooes for twentye dayes.</p>
            <p>For anſwere to the ſecond parte of this obiection, that Weauers ſtirre not ſo much, and therefore eate not ſo much as workemen of other trades: but Taylors, Shoomakers, and ſome other, ſtirre not ſo much as they, and therefore by their reaſon eate leſſe, and yet as yee haue ſeene
<pb facs="tcp:177788:156"/> haue more wages. But graunt that Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe eate leſſe meate then labourers, that which they ſpare from their belly ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they haue it not to eate, or if they will haue it ſo, becauſe they haue not ſo great a ſtomacke, they ſpende in their ſtrength, health and life, by getting colde and diſeaſes, as wee ſee they looke not ſo freſhe, nor liue not ſo long as labourers doe.</p>
            <p>But if there were nothing to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile that difference in apparell and dyet, is it reaſon that that which is ſpared from the poore mans backe and bellye, ſhould bee put into the Clothiers purſſe. It is not that the Prophet complaines of ſaying; <hi>Yee eate vp my people as it were</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 4</note> 
               <hi>bread.</hi> They keepe their riding Horſes and their Dogges fatte, but they keepe their worke-folkes both very poore and leane.</p>
            <p>But leaſt anye ſhould aske why I ſpeake not of Sheeremen, I am not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to their wages, but I ſuppoſe it is not great, by the littleneſſe of theyr eſtate that bee of that trade, diuers of them beeing the pooreſt in Townes, and none of them ritche that I knowe in theſe times: but I thinke Sheeremens
<pb facs="tcp:177788:156"/> wages is the beſt of the reſt, and yet not ſo much as the wages of workemen of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trades, for the greateſt wages of a Shereman that is hyred by the daye is but tenne pence, though he doe worke from foure till eight of the clocke, which is as I ſayde three houres longer then other tradeſmen doe woorke, that haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much wages.</p>
            <p>But if Sheeremans wages were not better then others that worke vnder Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers, they ſhould liue worſte of all, their tooles that they worke with bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo coſtly, their worke ſo vncertaine, that muſt waite vppon the weather, and continues commonly but for the Winter part of the yeare, and as it is vncertaine ſo it is diuerous, and hath many turne-againes and dangerous, for if they leaue a cloath on the Tainter and it be ſtolne they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for it: but although their wages be ſomwhat better then Weauers, by that time they haue forborne their mony ſome three, ſome ſixe moneths, by that time they haue attended about Clothiers other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe many houres and halfe dayes for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and by that time the loſſe they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine by taking deere commodities be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, I ſuppoſe there will bee no great
<pb facs="tcp:177788:157"/> difference, eſpecially by that time many of them haue beaten in flockes at leaſt, for ſome Clothiers to make the cloath carry a counterfet ſhew, &amp; haue ſet and dried their Cloathes vpon the Saboth day, and ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their conſcience as much as their Cloath vpon the taynter, they will be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d poore ſheremen, &amp; this is the reaſon in my iudgement according to reaſon, that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers growe more ſpeedily and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly ritch then other men, becauſe their worke is done for halfe the valewe that other mens is: for conſider with mee what it is to gaine by euery man that is their weauer, three pence or foure pence a day, by euery woman that is their burlier, Picker, Breaker or Spinner, two pence a daye and by euery childe that workes for them a penny or a halfe-penny a daye, if it were no more, what this amounts vnto, to thoſe Clothyers that haue fiue hundred, foure hundred, three hundred, or a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred working vnder them more or leſſe: or if yee will reckon it thus, that the Clothier gaines but a peny in euery pound of Woll ſpinning, as in the leaſt preſumption they muſt doe if it be weighed by the weightes of the Sanctuarie, it amountes to ſixe ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence in euery cloath, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:177788:157"/> about foure ſcore pound of yarne in a cloath, and if they gaine by the Weauer but halfe ſo much, although I haue heard workemen compare the Weauing and ſpinning equally together. To ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that they gaine by their burlers and pickers, who haue but three pence a daye, nor to ſpeake nothing of that they gaine by breakers and ſheermen, yet that they gaine by Weauers and Spinners in this ſmalleſt eſtimation, comes to ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in euery cloath, now to what ſumme growes that vnto them, that make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, 500. 400. 200. cloathes in a yeare.</p>
            <p>But they obiect againſt this, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they gaine not ten ſhillings in a cloth towards all their coſt and paines, but marke that, they ſay ſomtimes, I grant it; but that is ſildome when they are ouer-ſeene in the choiſe of their Oade, Indeco aſhes, or the like; or when their Oade ſetters are ouer-ſeene in ſetting their Fattes, but otherwiſe Clothiers themſelues haue confeſſed, that their ordinarie gaine at the leaſt reckoning is twice ten ſhillings in a cloath, not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe courſe ones that they call Roges, but of ſuch as may worthily beare the name of Broade cloathes, yea it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that oftentimes they gaine three
<pb facs="tcp:177788:158"/> times, foure times then ſhillings in a Cloath and more, it is not knowne what.</p>
            <p>But they ſay their gaines growes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then by their workefolkes, as by bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wooll, their oade, their indico, and the like, at the beſt hand, &amp; by ſelling their Clothes well, I anſwer; firſt for their buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except the corrupt deuices that ſome (I hope not all) doe vſe that way which I will not ſpeake of, my Text onely reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iniury to the poore, I ſuppoſe their gaine is not great that waye, but as it falles out in all ſuch vncertaine things, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they may gaine, and ſometime they may looſe, ſellers beeing as prouident as buyers: now for the gaine that they haue by ſelling, they meane by ſelling of time, to this I anſwere. Although I would haue ſuch gaine examined by the rule and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereby we condemne vſury, ſeeing they venture not charitably with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, but if his ſtate crackes not their ſtocke holdes, though his ſhip ſinkes: yet I deny not, but as they gaine ſometime by their buying, ſo they gaine often by this kind of ſelling, although ſome time they looſe by both. But their certaine, their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and ſo their chiefe gaine, I dare ſay in the iudgement of reaſon, is that they get
<pb facs="tcp:177788:158"/> by &amp; from the poore people, by the more cheape doing of their worke, then other mens, which is miſerable gaine, as if a man ſhould rob the ſpittle-houſe.</p>
            <p>Now as wee haue ſeene the Clothiers gaine, let vs ſee the poores loſſe: in the law when they bought men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for mony, &amp; kept them only for their worke, when the yeare of their freedome came, they might not ſend them awaye empty, but in this caſe I haue in hand, it is otherwiſe, that where ſome Clothiers dies worth twenty thouſand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſome worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath wrought vnder him not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but twenty yeare, dies not worth twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty groates: let it bee conſidered how the poore can liue of the wages they haue, as it is ſet downe before what they can earne, if they be wel and not hindred by ſickeneſſe, ſucking children or the like: but if any of theſe hindrances fall vnto them, how ſhall they buy them &amp; theirs bread, clothes, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood pay their houſe rent, and ſuch like neceſſaries for their life.</p>
            <p>Yea this abridgement of wages is a cauſe of all the miſery of the poore, both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, for by reaſon of their ſmall earnings, they cannot ſpare an houre in a weeke, but muſt take the Saboth to waſhe
<pb facs="tcp:177788:159"/> their cloathes, to peece their ragges, to fetch a bundle of wood, when they ſhould come to Church to ſerue God, yea they do not onely this way ſinne by occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but are hazarded vpon dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of pilfring &amp; ſtealing, as <hi>Agar</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Prou. 30.</note> 
               <hi>giue me not pouerty, leaſt I ſteale,</hi> which I feare is one woful meanes of many of the poores liuing, let it be conſidered Chriſtianly and equally if it bee not ſo that by this meanes a fewe Clothiers in a countrye growe ritch and many thouſandes growe poore, and if the inritching of two or three in a Towne, bee not the impoueriſhing of many, if I may not ſaye the hindring of all the Towne, for not onely thoſe that worke vnder them, finde it thoſe waies yee haue hard, but other Townſmen alſo: and not to ſpeake of that that other men beare out, rates according to their ability, that is ſeene when Clothiers go away, much more eaſily in that their ability is not ſeene, that other men maintaine the miniſter of their landes and labours, when Clothiers do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: that they do put away Corne, either that they buy for dayes, or that they haue growing, to their workefolkes at a greater rate then the market, &amp; ſo are occaſions of raiſing the price thorow the country. But
<pb facs="tcp:177788:159"/> onely to ſpeake of that that is pertinent, to my purpoſe that other men partly by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and partly by compaſſion are faine to releeue thoſe by charity, whome the Clothiers as before doe impoueriſh by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury, other men lend the poore money, Corne and other things, beeing faine to looſe it, when Clothiers if they lend them any thing will paye themſelues againe in their worke.</p>
            <p>The Prophets doe much and often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of ritch mens grinding the faces of the poore, flaying of their skinnes, &amp; buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the needy for ſiluer, and for ſhoes: now who may be charged with theſe things, in our time and in our country, but the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers that generally doe deale with them.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay the Marchantes deale as euill with their workemen, patching and preſſing them with commodities, if the Marchantes doe ſo, as I know ſome haue done, and thinke ſtill ſome doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are in the ſame condemnation, but who doth it in any compariſon of number or meaſure like the Clothiers, who haue all the time and all the labour and all the cunning, I wil not ſay of all, but of almoſt all the poore, for all which in the winding vp the poore get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a lowſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177788:160"/>
            <p>But as it is wiſedome and iuſtice in all controuerſies, to heare both tales, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their perticuler obiections that before haue fallen in by the way, let vs heare fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what Clothiers can aleadge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, either againſt this occaſion, or for their owne accuſation.</p>
            <p>Clothiers pleade for the defence of their courſe in this wages, and ſay they may giue their workefolkes leſſe wages then others doe, becauſe they ſet their workefolkes on worke all the yeare, when others ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doe want worke, by the waye, marke that wee haue their confeſſion, that they giue their workefolkes leſſe wages then other men doe theirs: now they ſaye they may doe ſo for this reaſon, that they ſet them on worke all the yeare, which ſaye they, others doe not: but to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, if they doe ſet them on worke all the yeare, they haue the more gaine, and not the leſſe worke, is this a good reaſon, that becauſe the poore doe leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their worke, therefore they maye ſhorten their wages: but moſt Clothyers doe not ſet the poore on worke all the yeare, but all Labourers and Maſons doe ſometime want worke in Winter, ſo doe their workefolkes in Summer, and their
<pb facs="tcp:177788:160"/> workefolkes in Summer doe worke in the fieldes about Haye or Corne, and haue the wages of Labourers aforeſaid, that is foure pence and ſixe pence a day, and meate and drinke, but in Winter when Labourers ſhall want worke &amp; ſhall ſpinne and carde vnder them they cannot earne two pence or three pence, towardes their bread and drinke, and whereas husbandmen giue better diet and better wages in harueſt for their haſt, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being the Clothiers time of harueſt and haſt, they giue no more then their former pittance.</p>
            <p>The Clothiers ſay we can haue our worke done thus, &amp; if one will not another will. I anſwere, neceſſity hath no law, the poore muſt worke ſot little rather then ſit ſtill for nothing, for among the Clothiers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues there is this prouerbe; Of a hard earned pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man may liue, but of none he cannot: in other caſes they can ſee, and would ſaye men muſt not looke what they can haue, or what they can doe, but what they may and what they ſhould.</p>
            <p>They haue another obiection much like the former, the poore were better doe thus then doe nothing, becauſe (for that muſt follow) that halfe a loafe is better then no breade, true, but if they themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:177788:161"/> ſhould giue a pennye for a halfe penny loafe, it would in time make them haue a thin purſe and thin cheekes. That I may omit nothing that they can ſaye for themſelues, it is further obiected, that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hath beene made, and the poore will earne more in Clothiers worke, then they can doe in any other worke. But if they meane by poore men of other trades, as Maſons, Shoomakers, Taylors, Thatchers, Labourers, &amp;c. Then it is vntrue, for I haue ſhewed before, that all theſe haue much more, &amp; many of them double their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes wages: therefore they muſt meane women and children, and then I anſwere; though this that they ſaye of them were true, yet this doth not iuſtifie their giuing of ſmall wages, becauſe in no other worke they can make better earnings, for that woll in our country is the commoneſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie whereunto the poore haue beene moſt vſed, becauſe wollen cloath is moſt vendable at home and abroade, and the poore haue not bin vſed to worke in hemp, flaxe, or any thing here aboutes but wooll: therfore it is no maruell, though being try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe things they are vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withal, they can earne little, ſpecially at the firſt, but yet their obiection ſo farre as
<pb facs="tcp:177788:161"/> it concernes women and children, namely that they can earne more in Clothiers worke, then in other worke in vntrue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our clothiers meane to ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder Clothiers worke, thoſe that make White, Bayes and Sayes, &amp;c. Which my purpoſe is to deuide from them, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe only Blew men, eſpecially in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part with this iniuſtice, for thoſe that ſpin Dutch worke do earne more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can in Blew worke, for they that make Baies and Sayes, ſome giue a penny for the ſpinning of ſix knots, ſome a peny for ſeuen knots, &amp; ſome a penny for eight knots, we will take it in the middeſt, that the poore haue a penny for ſeuen knots: our Clothiers that put out their worke to bee ſpunne by the knot, giue but a penny for nine knots, now this is the difference betweene their knots the Bay men or Dutchmen, they haue eighty yards ſpunne for a knot of their worke ready carded or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bed, &amp; our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers haue forty elles ſpun for a knot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, now account the carding, as it is ful halfe the worke, waying the wearing of their cardes, and count the two knots that Clothiers haue done more then the other, and account forty quarters, that makes
<pb facs="tcp:177788:162"/> tenne yardes in euery knot which is nine times ten yardes in euery penny, which makes two knots more, and then you may ſee that thoſe that ſpinne for Clothiers doe foure knots in euery peny more then thoſe that ſpinne Dutch worke. If the Clothiers will ſay they may ſpin their worke faſter, I anſwere that is not alwayes ſo, for ſome Clothiers ſending their worke halfe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and halfe ſeamed, dooth much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and yet if it were alwayes ſo, the handſomeneſſe and cleanelineſſe of the Dutch worke in compariſon of theirs will recompence that differene, beſides when women ſpinne wooll for other men, either to make ſtockings or ſuch like, they haue three pence for the worſt, foure pence, and fiue pence a pound, which is duble Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers wages, &amp; men that be Linnen Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers can earne twelue pence in a day, when their weauers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not earne aboue ſix pence, thoſe that weaue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try worke as they call it, our huſwifes cloath can earne 12. pence in a day, when if they weaue for clothiers they cannot earne ſixe pence, thoſe that weaue Pouldauis can earne nine &amp; ten pence a day thoſe that beate hemp &amp; ſuch like in bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well can earne ten pence &amp; 12. pence a day, finding themſelues, yea if women &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:162"/> can finde any thing elſe to do, they will not worke vnder the Clothier, if they can haue either Crabs, Slowes, Peſcodes, gleaning broome, birtch, or ruſhes in the fieldes, they will not doe their worke, as themſelues will confeſſe, that in ſometime of Summer they can get no ſpinning, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but this, they giue ſo little wages, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers obiect and ſay, there can but few in compariſon bee ſet a worke otherwiſe then vnder them; grant that, and grant withall that Clothiers haue the time, cunning, and ſtrength, as I ſaid before of thoſe multitude, and that the more worke vnder them, the more they gaine by them: will either equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, charity or humanity ſuffer, that they ſhould haue their worke without anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wages. Clothiers aske how the poore would liue if they did not ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on worke, aſwell they might aske how Sailors would liue if marchants or owners of ſhips did not imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or how any other whoſe liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood ſtands vpon their cunning &amp; labour would liue if they were not ſet a worke, but woll as hath bin ſaid, being the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, there muſt be cloath making to ſerue not only our own but other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries &amp; much people muſt be imploied that way, as in France they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

That I may omit nothing that they can ſaye for themſelues, it is further obiected, that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hath beene made, and the poore will earne more in Clothiers worke, then they can doe in any other worke. But if they meane by poore men of other trades, as Maſons, Shoomakers, Taylors, Thatchers, Labourers, &amp;c. Then it is vntrue, for I haue ſhewed before, that all theſe haue much more, &amp; many of them double their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes wages: therefore they muſt meane women and children, and then I anſwere; though this that they ſaye of them were true, yet this doth not iuſtifie their giuing of ſmall wages, becauſe in no other worke they can make better earnings, for that woll in our country is the commoneſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie whereunto the poore haue beene moſt vſed, becauſe wollen cloath is moſt vendable at home and abroade, and the poore haue not bin vſed to worke in hemp, flaxe, or any thing here aboutes but wooll: therfore it is no maruell, though being try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe things they are vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withal, they can earne little, ſpecially at the firſt, but yet their obiection ſo farre as
<pb facs="tcp:177788:163"/> it concernes women and children, namely that they can earne more in Clothiers worke, then in other worke is vntrue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept out clothiers meane to ioyne with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder Clothiers worke, thoſe that make White, Bayes and Sayes, &amp;c. Which my purpoſe is to deuide from them, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe only Blew men, eſpecially in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part with this iniuſtice, for thoſe that ſpin Dutch worke do earne more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can in Blew worke, for they that make Baies and Sayes, ſome giue a penny for the ſpinning of ſix knots, ſome a peny for ſeuen knots, &amp; ſome a penny for eight knots, we will take it in the middeſt, that the poore haue a penny for ſeuen knots: our Clothiers that put out their worke to bee ſpunne by the knot, giue but a penny for nine knots, now this is the difference betweene their knots the Bay men or Dutchmen, they haue eighty yards ſpunne for a knot of their worke ready carded or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bed, &amp; our Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers haue forty elles ſpun for a knot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, now account the carding, as it is ful halfe the worke, waying the wearing of their cardes, and count the two knots that Clothiers haue done more then the other, and account forty quarters, that makes

If the Clothiers will ſay they may ſpin their worke faſter, I anſwere that is not alwayes ſo, for ſome Clothiers ſending their worke halfe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and halfe ſeamed, dooth much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and yet if it were alwayes ſo, the handſomeneſſe and cleanelineſſe of the Dutch worke in compariſon of their will recompence that differene, beſides when women ſpinne wooll for other men, either to make ſtockings or ſuch like, they haue three pence for the worſt, foure pence, and fiue pence a pound, which is double Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers wages, &amp; men that be Linnen Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers can earne twelue pence in a day, when their weauers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not earne aboue ſix pence, thoſe that weaue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try worke as they call it, or huſwifes cloath can earne 12. pence in a day, when if they weaue for clothiers they cannot earne ſixe pence, thoſe that weaue Pouldauis can earne nine &amp; ten pence a day thoſe that beate hemp &amp; ſuch like in bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well can earne ten pence &amp; 12. pence a day, finding themſelues, yea if women &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:177788:164"/> can finde any thing elſe to do, they will not worke vnder the Clothier, if they can haue either Crabs, Slowes, Peſcodes, gleaning broome, birtch, or ruſhes in the fieldes, they will not doe their worke, as themſelues will confeſſe, that in ſometime of Summer they can get no ſpinning, what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but this, they giue ſo little wages, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers obiect and ſay, there can but few in compariſon bee ſet a worke otherwiſe then vnder them; grant that, and grant withall that Clothiers haue the time, cunning, and ſtrength, as I ſaid before of thoſe multitude, and that the more worke vnder them, the more they gaine by them: will either equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, charity or humanity ſuffer, that they ſhould haue their worke without anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wages. Clothiers aske how the poore would liue if they did not ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on worke, aſwell they might aske how Sailors would liue if marchants or owners of ſhips did not imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or how any other whoſe liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood ſtands vpon their cunning &amp; labour would liue if they were not ſet a worke, but woll as hath bin ſaid, being the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, there muſt be cloath making to ſerue not only our own but other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, &amp; much people muſt be imploied that way, as in France they be imploied in
<pb facs="tcp:177788:165"/> gathering of grapes, and treading of wine-preſſes. But as Clothiers aske how the poore would liue if they were not ſet a worke by them, ſo I aske how the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would liue and haue their worke done without them, they will anſwere; they would keepe ſeruants in their houſes to do it, they could not haue the tenth part done that is now, and yet it would be more then double the charge to them it is now. Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers aleadge further for their defence, it was thus before we were borne, I anſwere, it is like the ſaying that ſome vſe in the caſe of Tithes, there was neuer more paide ſaye they, when their knowledge reaches but to yeſterday in compariſon of euer, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but if it were ſo as the Clothiers ſay, preſcription is no good plea in an euill thing, yet though it might bee thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall then when all things were at a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer rate, it cannot be equall now when all things are doubled, and ſome things tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in price.</p>
            <p>If the poore ſhall paye very deare for the things they muſt liue by, as their come, their white-meate, their wood, and the like, and take very cheape for that they ſhould liue by, that is their worke, tell mee
<pb facs="tcp:177788:165"/> what a harmony this will make. And if it were ſo, wil Clothiers holde the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the poores worke, and not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prices for their Cloath: but Clothiers ſay their wooll and other commodities coſt them dearer then in old time; of their owne mouth we will condemne them, for ſhall the price of all other things been increaſed and not the price of the poores worke, is it equall that they ſhould giue more for that they receiue of the ritch, and not giue more for that they receaue of the poore.</p>
            <p>They ſaye they followe the common courſe, that all other Clothiers doe in this point, true indeed, if it were but the abuſe of one or two, I would haue thought it my dutie to reſt in a priuate admonition, but becauſe it is ſo common a thing, it requires a publike reprehention, but the moe the worſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 1</note> 
               <hi>a multitude to doe euill:</hi> they aleadge they can giue no more wages, to liue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Let Clothiers themſelues anſwere this ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſome of them, haue in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication confeſſed, that their gaine ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time haue beene too great, when they haue doubled their ſtocke in one yeare, other
<pb facs="tcp:177788:166"/> haue confeſſed they haue gained almoſt ſo much by making out one loade of Wooll, as their wooll coſt them, others haue ſaid, if they meete with ſure marchants, it is the beſt trade vnder heauen. Let the waight of this publike cauſe obtaine pardon, for this reherſall of priuate ſpeeches, ſpecially mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no man, further let the ſtate of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers anſwere this allegation, who for their wealth may bee preferred before all other yeomen, and compared to many, if I may not ſay any Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Let the manner of their liuing anſwere this allegation, beſides that which they ſpare, they ſpend ſome 300<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome 200. ſome 100. pound, ſome a hundred marke a yeare, when their poore workefolke ſpare nothing but ſpend their cheekes. Some clothiers ſay they giue a farthing or a halfe penny in a pound for ſpinning more then was wont to be giuen, other deny this and ſay it was as much thirty yeare a goe, but grant this that ſome doe ſo, yet thoſe that doe ſo their worke is not ſo well broken as is was wont, &amp; therfore it is worſe to carde, it is not ſo well ſeimed as it was wont, and therefore they haue not only more Wooll to the pound, but alſo it is worſe to ſpinne,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:166"/> and the Clothier will haue it drawne much ſmaller then in time paſt, for in time paſt they put fiue ſcore and foure ſcore and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene pound in a cloth, and now they put but foure ſcore or foure ſcore &amp; foure, that is as long as the former, and ſo it is a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thread and is worſe to reele, which things laide togeather, it appeares for this halfe penny or farthing, the ſpinners doe a penniworth of worke at the leaſt, and ſo gaine by it as <hi>Dickins</hi> did by his diſhes, ſome Clothyers alſo ſaye they giue twelue pence and two ſhillinges in a Cloath more fore Weauing then was vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in ancient time, but I haue heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirme the cleane contrarye, that the clothes they were wont to giue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye ſhillings for, now they giue but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or fifteene ſhillings.</p>
            <p>But ſome Weauers doe confeſſe that ſome Clothiers for ſome courſe clothes do ſo, but for that they take away the thrums that Weauers were wont to haue, they will haue their Cloath ſtopt at leaſt at one end, and for that the yearne of thoſe courſe clothes is drawne almoſt as ſmall as of their fine clothes, the hindra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they haue with knitting of knots thorow the often
<pb facs="tcp:177788:167"/> breaking of their looſe and twittered yarne, ſtands the weauer in foure ſhillings or fiue ſhillings, for that twelue pence, and this prooues it to bee ſo, becauſe Weauers could in time paſt weaue three of thoſe cloathes, in the time that they can weaue two now: and as this is the loſſe of the Weauer, ſo it is the gaine of the Clothier, for the ſmalneſſe of the yarne makes it goe much further, and makes the cloath finer, though neuer the better. So that yee ſee that the increaſe of their wages that Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers ſpeake of, is the deminiſhing of their wages, and that worke folkes get by it ouer the ſhoulders: and that it is ſo, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by this, that worke-folkes of theſe trades cannot liue ſo well by much, vnder the Clothiers now, as they haue done in times paſt.</p>
            <p>If they will ſay, that is becauſe they haue not ſo much worke as in time paſt, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that is not all the cauſe, for thoſe that haue worke enough haue too much a doe to liue, for yee may conceiue in reaſon what a portion of liuing the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of wages will affoorde. Therefore theſe allegations of giuing more wages then in times paſt, when they knowe that
<pb facs="tcp:177788:167"/> there is more time ſpent, and more worke done then in time paſt, cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from an euill conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Clothiers ſay though they ſhould giue more wages for their worke, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant would giue neuer the more for their Cloth, but the reaſon of Marchantes ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at priſes, is as I take it, becauſe their Cloath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commonly is ſo bad, and Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers gaines ſo ſufficient, but if their Cloath were good, and they could not afforde it ſo good cheape, Marchants muſt and would giue a greater price; but if Marchantes did not increaſe their price, Clothiers might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their wages, that the poore might liue better, and yet themſelues liue well enough.</p>
            <p>Clothiers obiect that ſome that worke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them grow ritch, but I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of their wages, except ſome rare perſon, that keepes himſelfe ſingle, and bee of extraordinary hardneſſe and diſpoſition of ſparing, and if he be marryed hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall helpe by his wiues portion and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour, &amp; no hindrance by any charge, or ſome other furtherance by ſome friends, to keepe a cow or two they cannot liue, but if any of thoſe workefolkes which I haue
<pb facs="tcp:177788:168"/> anotomized before, except peraduenture ſome that God will ſpecially bleſſe, as hee makes good his promiſe of bleſſing in all degrees that waye, as in ſome hee makes good the threatning of his curſſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the common ſorte, if they attaine to any wealth, if it be not by ſtealing, it is by buying of flockes and courſe wooll, by making of remnants and climing to it by Clothiers ſteps, and not by their worke and wages.</p>
            <p>Clothiers ſaye there will alwayes bee poore, as the Scripture ſaith: it is true, there will alwayes bee blinde, ſicke, and lame, that cannot worke, and there will be ſome other poore that God will puniſh with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie for their ſinnes, and ſome that God will exerciſe with pouertie for their tryall, though it commonly comes to paſſe by meanes of the oppreſſion of the ritch: but becauſe there will bee poore, can that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them that make them poore. It is in this caſe as it is in that our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeakes of offences; <hi>Neceſſary it is that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences ſhould come, but woe be to that man by</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 8.</note> 
               <hi>whome they doe come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clothiers ſaye they would bee poore though they had neuer ſo much wages, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:177788:168"/> ſome would be leane though they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much meate, ſhall men therefore with-holde from them compitent foode, but though ſome would be vnthriftie, yet others no doubt are as carefull to thriue in their calling, as Clothiers bee in theirs, if they had meanes for it.</p>
            <p>Clothiers ſay the people be as poore in other countryes as they be in this countrie, it may be ſo, for the eſtate of ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is more harde and homely then ours, as it is ſayde the Mayiors and chiefe men of ſome Townes and corporations haue beene Thatchers, but if the people bee poore by the prouidence of God and not by the oppreſſion of men, it is not the thing that I meddle withall, but thoſe that ſhall haue the labour and ſweate of Gods people, and not rewarde them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of equitie, this is the matter that I reprooue, and if in thoſe countries they ſpeake of there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of trade that giue ſo little wages for ſo much worke, yet if they themſelues bee of meane eſtate, and the woorke whereabout the poore are imployed will yeelde them no ſuch gaine or aduantage as to giue anye greater recompence,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:169"/> and ſo doe proportionably, though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, beare the hardneſſe of the time and place with the other, this is not the thing that I condemne, but when any that ſet poore on worke ſhall be of great abilitie, and the labour of the poore affoording them great profit, as it is with Clothiers, and yet they ſhall not rewarde them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently for their labour, but by defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abridging their wages, they growe ritch by others pouertie, this is the woefull gaine that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of here, and that they are like to paye deere for at the laſt.</p>
            <p>And as Clothiers ſay, they bee as poore in other countries where be no Clothiers, ſo they ſaye there bee as poore of other trades in this countrie, but obſerue it, and you ſhall finde, there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the number of poore of other trades, put them all together, and thoſe that worke vnder Clothiers: and yet thoſe that be poore of other trades, how growes it ordinarilye, not from the littleneſſe and likeneſſe of their wages with the Clothiers workefolkes, for yee haue ſeene the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them before, but it ſeemes to growe from hence, that their wiues and children who worke vnder the Clothyer
<pb facs="tcp:177788:169"/> for ſuch trifling wages as I haue ſpoken of, doe eate vp that the men doe earne.</p>
            <p>Clothiers ſay the poore doe ſteale from them, it is like many of them doe, though themſelues be the occaſion of ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: it is a faulte in thoſe poore that doe ſo, and the Scripture reprooues it in other places, and appoints puniſhment for it, but it is the other kinde of theft that Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vſe to them, that <hi>Iames</hi> controules here, as one ſaith; There bee ſome theeues doe weare chaines of Iron, and ſome doe were chaines of Golde: if the poore had as good meanes to puniſh this kinde of theft, as Clothiers haue to puniſh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I would neuer haue ſet my Penne to Paper for them.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the Clothiers ſay, it is a good thing to ſet the poore a worke: True it is, ſo as the poore in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may haue a conuenient refreſhing, a comfortable expectation, and equall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their worke, otherwiſe a man may do euill in ſetting the poore a worke, as <hi>Pharao</hi> did euill in ſetting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to make Bricke, and as theſe men did that ſet the poore to reape their fields, when it tends to iniury and oppreſſion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177788:170"/>
            <p>Yet ſome of them thinke it their vertue thus to ſet the poore a worke, but if it bee a vertue, it muſt be a vertue of the ſecond Table, and muſt either be equitie, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie equitie: it is not as I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe it agrees not with any of the rules of equitie, and charitie it is not, for that is ouer and aboue equitie.</p>
            <p>But let vs in a worde of two a little conſider of ſome Clothiers charitie, which I ſpeake of not as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to ſhame them, but as my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued brethren to admoniſh them, and to take away the ſhadowes that vſe to blinde them: for I knowe not my ſelfe if I haue any other purpoſe in this diſcourſe then to profit them one waye, and thoſe that I plead for another waye. Some Clothiers doe giue foure pence, ſome ſixe pence a weeke to the poore, but one or two of their Spinners doe bring it them home againe by Tueſday night in their worke, then what doe they and the reſt of their workfolkes bring &amp; giue them, ſome a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſome two pence, ſome three pence and foure pence euery day in their worke, &amp; ſo the Clothiers fill their houſes with ſpoile, and where they would be aſhamed to take
<pb facs="tcp:177788:170"/> an almes of any ritch man, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to take an almes of euery poore man: they bid their poore workfolkes at Chriſtmas to a dinner, but what is that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they dine with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twenty times in a yeare. Let Clothiers pay the poore competently for their worke &amp; keepe their pottage, and if they did ſo, ſome of their moth-eaten garments would bee of the poore folkes backes, and ſome of their fattie platters of the poore folkes tables: but a word or two more of Clothiers charitie. Some of them will at their death giue the poore fiue pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or ten pound; indeede ſomewhat is better then nothing, and better late then neuer: but thoſe Clothiers that haue liued in any great occupying but ten yeare, if when they dye they ſhould giue to the poore ten ſcore pound, in my iudgment they ſhould dye in their debt.</p>
            <p>But that I may omit nothing that may be ſaid for Clothiers, and that by their beſt friends it is obiected, that many Clothiers be religious men, and the ſpecialeſt men in Townes, &amp; ſuch as haue bin ſpeciall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to further the goſpell. It is true; <hi>The grace of God hath appeared, and brings ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus. 2.</note> 
               <hi>to all men,</hi> that is, all ſortes of men,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:171"/> and ſo to Clothiers aſwell as others, and God forbid that I ſhould denie them all the good opinion of religion, more then to anye other men of anye other lawfull trade. And but that I will not ſpeake perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againſt any, I could ſpeake perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly for ſome.</p>
            <p>But for all that, let vs iudge of religion not as wee conceit it, but as the Scripture<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> ſpeakes of it: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Religion hath Godlineſſe ioyned with it, and it hath Juſtice</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ioyned with it:</hi> as it is ſayd of <hi>Iob, Cornelius,</hi> and other religious men, they were iuſt and feared God: It hath mercy ioyned<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> with it, as <hi>James</hi> ſayth; <hi>Pure religion and vndefiled before God.</hi> Is this to viſite the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe and widowes in their aduerſitie, and to keepe himſelfe vnſpotted of the worlde.</p>
            <p>But what contrarye things are there in moſt Clothiers, I ſpeake not of all, but yet of ſome that pretend religion, what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe and breach of the Sabboth daye is there among them, and that ordinarilye by themſelues, their ſeruants, their worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, their cattell in iournying, ſending and receiuing of cloathes too and from Mill, ſetting their Fattes, ſetting their
<pb facs="tcp:177788:171"/> Taynters drying their Wooll, &amp;c. AS if theirs were ſuch a Goulden trade, that Godlineſſe it ſelfe muſt giue place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>What vſurie, yea what biting vſurie doe moſt, may I not ſay all Clothiers commit in putting out their clothes to Marchants not for ten in the hundred, but for twenty, for thirty in the hundred, which doubtleſſe is one cauſe of the breaking and vndoing of many Marchants at this day. What extreame deceite doe Clothiers vſe, not onely to the poore, as I ſayd before, but to all the Queenes ſubiects, yea to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of other countries, in ſetting a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet gloſe vpon their cloath at one end, and ſtraining it from end to end, ſo that it is not that within that it ſeemes to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it is not ſo long nor ſo broad, ſo iuſt nor ſo ſtrong as it ſeemes to bee, but will ſhrinke vnreaſonably, which I ſpeake not onely in anſwere to the former obiection, but in the way of an admonition to ioyne practiſe of religion vnto profeſſion. For conſidering the number of the poore, the manner of their liuing, and that by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the vneuen proportion of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers dealing, I cannot ſufficiently pittie
<pb facs="tcp:177788:172"/> it in the poore, nor miſlike it in them, and I do verilie thinke if <hi>Ieremie</hi> had ſeene ſuch a thing as this, he would haue put it among his Lamentations. I pray God mooue the Maieſtrates by ſome meanes to conſider how it might bee reformed, eyther ſome other way that may ſeeme good to their wiſedome, or by appointing Clothiers to put out all their ſpinning by the knot, and that they may giue a penny for ſo many knottes of courſe worke, and for thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of fine worke, as ſhall be thought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitent for the poore, and to allowe ſo much for the Weauing as is giuen for the ſpinning, which is thought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionable. Theſe two things in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would amende all this diſorder, though there were no medling with the wages of their pickers, burlers, breakers, or any other, for then if they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the wages of burlers and ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they would not doe that worke, but ſpinne, and if they did not giue compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wages to other men that worke vnder them, they would not doe that worke but Weaue.</p>
            <p>And where the Clothiers will obiect, then the poore will not doe their worke
<pb facs="tcp:177788:172"/> well, if they be tyed to giue them certaine wages: the anſwere is, they haue the ſame bridle for that which they haue now, to change their workefolkes. But conſidering the multitude of poore, the Clothiers haue gotten the lawe into their owne hand, as wee ſaye, the liberty that they haue, and practiſe that they vſe to abridge the wages of their workefolkes, is a cauſe of all the miſery of the poore people in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie at this day. But vntill there be a lawe to binde them that be euill in this trade, let euery good man, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> bee a lawe to himſelfe, and labour to doe well, and well will come on it Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſome good men Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet moſt of them, if I may not ſay all of them, doe wante eyther conſcience or conſideration. Nowe to helpe them in this, I would haue them diligently marke what the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith here; <hi>Goe to howle and weepe for the miſerie that ſhall come vpon you, the labourers wages that haue reaped downe your fieldes which is of you kept backe by fraude cryeth againſt you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I preached this Sermon, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged theſe wordes againſt Clothiers, ſome obiected that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes not againſt
<pb facs="tcp:177788:173"/> them, but againſt husbandmen, but ſo a man may put all doctrine from himſelfe, becauſe the Scripture ſpeakes not of his name, of his country or trade, but we muſt know if if be the ſame fault, thought it be in another perſon or trade, it deſerues the ſame reproofe and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>It was further obiected, that the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpeakes not againſt thoſe that gaue too little wages, but againſt them that gaue none at all. By which kinde of caueling we ſee how loath this diuell is to be caſt out: but ſhall we thinke they were ſo inhumane and barbarous, being of the Church, as to giue them nothing at all for their worke: if that had beene ſo, the Apoſtle needed not haue ſaide after in the eight verſe to the poore; <hi>Be patient therefore brethren till the comming of the Lord;</hi> for they muſt haue dyed quickely, but hee ſpeakes of ſuch an iniury as was a continuall exerciſe of their patience. To conclude the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>The cry of the poore is entred into the eares of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord of Hoaſtes;</hi> the like is ſaide: That the blood of <hi>Abell</hi> cryed for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caine,</hi> ſo it is ſaide, the cry of <hi>Sodome</hi> was exceeding great: the ſtone in the wall<note place="margin">Abac. 2. 11.</note> and the beame in the houſe ſhal cry againſt
<pb facs="tcp:177788:173"/> thoſe that ſet them vp by euill meanes.</p>
            <p>It is true that all ſinnes doe come to the eares of the Lorde, but ſome ſinnes bee ſo monſtrous and prodigeous, that he dooth vehemently witneſſe his knowledge and miſliking of them then others, God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lord of Hoaſtes or God of armies, becauſe he hath al creatures at commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to execute his iudgementes, he had Beares to deuoure the children that moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> he had dogges to deuoure <hi>Ieſabell,</hi> he had Flies, Frogs, and Lice, to deuour the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> &amp; he hath an hoaſt of Angelles to take vengeance of wicked men, it is ſaid, <hi>Defraude not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>in any matter, for God is an auenger of all ſuch things;</hi> and it is ſaide: <hi>No vnrighteous</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>perſon ſhall inherite the kingdome of God,</hi> meaning if he continue ſo and repent not, to leaue his vnrighteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Lay theſe Scriptures to your courſe, and then doe that that belonges to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, looke without parciality into it, and I hope yee will ſee it looke farre enough vnto the time when yee muſt anſwere it, and then I doubt not yee will reforme it. Now if the ſinne be ſo great to keepe back the wages of thoſe that labour corporally,
<pb facs="tcp:177788:174"/> what is it to keepe backe the wages of thoſe that labour ſpiritually? for Chriſt ſaith of thoſe, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his wages;</hi> and the more excellent the labour is, the greater wages is due vnto it: but I would haue the indignitye and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of this conſidered, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the former, and ſo will end with this prayer to God, that hee would draw vs and keepe vs from both theſe euilles, and teach and ſtrengthen vs eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waye to doe well.</p>
